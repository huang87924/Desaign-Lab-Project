But as a member of the industry, I know that the technology is that powerful, and observing our country's slow decline into authoritarianism I think William's concern is legitimate.

What few realize is that the technology for ingesting information and using methods such as machine learning to extract meaning from it is evolving at lightning speed. Some may remember the Times article in 2012 describing how Target deduced that a teenage customer was pregnant before her father knew. A lot has happened in five years, and the next five will astonish everyone. We are not ready for this.

I have two adult children and I have warned them: You will live in a different world than I have. Every single thing you do or say will be recorded and analyzed by some computer somewhere. And there is little standing between your innocent expectations of privacy and due process and someone in government or business who will exploit it without regard for your interests, or even with malignant intent. 

With a business-friendly Congress unable to protect us from an incompetent and dangerous poseur in the presidency, I am very worried on behalf of my children.

1,"Following my earlier comment, if you really want to ruin your Sunday you should follow up the Op-Ed by watching this video, produced by AI professors, that has gone viral. It shows how AI will not just 'police' innocent children but decide which to kill:

3,"I was just thinking about how AI might have helped us in Vietnam. With improved data on enemy deployments, we could have dragged the war out another five years before admitting our involvement was a bad policy from the beginning."
4,"I agree 100%, Ms. Williams.   AI is going to be very important in the future.  It must be as unbiased as possible, and the programming must be checked for bias regularly.  We can never condone bias or racism in any AI, just as we can never tolerate it in humans.

Thank you for an excellent analysis."
5,"The US is distinguished by Darwinian economic policies and segregation based on race and income. Tech can be used to reinforce this.  

But we've ignored the real dangers..
How about using AI to predict the Trump win, and his worsening behavior after taking office?

Couldn't we have easily predicted the increase in financial crime, leading up to the crash of 08 and all its damage?  Would we need computers to warn us after the Gop and Clinton cooperated to repeal long standing bank regulations in '90s? Wall St became a high crime neighborhood. But policing it is very untrendy in our politics---it's called big govt intrusion. 

What would Artificial Intelligence have predicted about the dominance of the corporate elites taking over our election campaigns, subsidizing both parties, after the Court's Citizens United decision said big money equals free speech? 

Destructive trends were easy to see. Or is our politics not interested in that kind of prediction?"
6,"The author and many commenters here share a fundamental misunderstanding of machine learning.  It is not a bunch of racist white coders generating series after series of if - then - else statements leading to some solution.   It is more closely explained as a machine training on millions upon millions of examples in essence teaching itself to recognize patterns in those examples.   

If it recognizes patterns that suggest that some groups are more prone to crime and violence than others it is not bias.  I guess it is possible for those providing the examples the machine is training on are dishonest, but that would be pointless and counterproductive. "
7,"Everyone should be terrified of AI and it's use by the police and the government who will be the ""criminals"" of tomorrow.   The truth is AI doesn't think on its own;  it's programed by humans and those humans can pretty much do what they like.  They can slant  criteria against a race, a creed, a gender, a philosophy or a set or subset of political views.  AI has been given patina  of infallibility and that's terrifying. 

We need to stop handing out lives and our freedom over to machines who will not be amenable to dispute or we really are doomed."
8,"Ms. Williams should perhaps consider that most of Oakland was not until relatively recently a place in which a lawyer and an engineer would choose to raise children, and that aggressive enforcement, including using knowledge about past criminal activity to focus on hot spots, was one of the things that helped bring crime rates, in particular the rate of homicide, down. Or at least did until some of the ""Obama-era criminal justice reform policies"" Ms. Williams touts lead to a twenty-percent rise in homicides nationally in only the last two years. Criminal justice policies that use data of actual past crime, including and in particular homicide, which is for obvious reasons the easiest crime to identify (it leaves bodies), helped make cities like Oakland safe enough that one could go out for a haircut or a hoagie without the fear of being killed."
9,"My favorite technology for understanding crime is BI, not AI. B refers to books. In BI, people like Michelle Alexander use person-learning research algorithms developed over the centuries by live human historians, statisticians, political and social scientists, and other experts in BI to unravel the ties between race and crime. Then they write books, like for example ""The New Jim Crow,"" which explains how the War on Drugs has violentized black neighborhoods, exactly like Alcohol Prohibition violentized Italian neighborhoods back in the 1920s.

If we were to have this debate in 1927, it would be the Italian Americans who'd be replacing African Americans as the targeted population for stereotypes and naive statistical projections by conservative white people.

Americans solved the Italian-on-Italian crime problem in the inner cities by repealing the ban on alcohol sales, allowing the alcohol industry to be run by people who were not criminal psychopaths.

How would any machine ever be able to parse that? We need more BI more than we need AI. "
10,"Perhaps some criticism this articles presents is valid; specifically of a supposed bias of racial profiling and the resulting arrests and thus ""statistics"" that end up going into the system which ""intelligent"" policing uses as a framework for analysis. 

Some statistics however can't be explained away easily such as the homicide rate of the African American community while accounting for 13% of the population also account for 50% of homicides.  That's not a bias or an example of biased policing. Murder is murder.

Either way it all needs to be addressed. 

Consider racial profiling just as individuals based on surroundings. If I drive 45 mins south to the Inglewood neighborhood of Chicago, I will most assuredly be ""racially"" profiling as well as age profiling and specifically ""apparel"" and clothing style profiling, especially if my wife or kids are with me.

Everyone who lives there and goes through there is going to the same. "
11,"We should all be wary of the advances of tech that are profiling us all.

12,"The real issue is that AI is based on data that is based on black crime.  And she has to deceive the reader by suggesting that drug use is the same as drug dealing.  Furthermore, that claim is false as blacks use drugs more than whites. She then jumps to the conclusion that police arrest blacks at random, fearing her son will be arrested for no reason at the barber shop. This is nonsense.  The police need probable cause to make an arrest. One would think an attorney would know that. Anyway, it?s a good idea for her and her children to avoid high crime black areas given the rate of black-on-black crime. Clearly, she and her husband are affirmative action hires at that tech company because no company would hire someone so ignorant in such an important legal position without the impetus of affirmative action.

13,"We are all in favor of the scientific method (sans certain Republican politicians, who like to remind us that 'they are not scientists) when it helps us get an uber or a pizza faster, but we get worried when the same methods are applied to social problems.  How do we determine the risk of an event occuring?  It depends, in part on the probablility of the event occuiring in the past (a statistical approach worked out by Bayes many years ago). For example, if five people on average don't show up for their flight, the airlines can oversell flights by five seats and most of the time no one will need to be bumped.  But can we apply this same quantitative method to social issues?  I would assume that the next terriorist attack in the US will be performed by someone who claims to be Muslim, solely because every other attach for the past decade has been.  Does that mean every Muslim is bad?  Of course not, but the pool of possible suspects can certainly be narrowed by applying this criteria. Similarly, if a certain percent of violent crimes are performed by people of certain genders, ages, and races, that information predicts the likelihood of a future event being performed by someone who matches those demographics.  This is simply empirically true, it has nothing to do with bias or prejudice. How the world uses this information is the problem - we love using statstical approaches to get a cheaper hotel room,  but when they are applied to human problems they become 'profiling.'..."
14,"""This is a function of the beliefs, assumptions and capabilities of the people who do the coding. A.I. learns by repetition and association, and all of that is based on the information we ? humans who hold all the racial and often, specifically, anti-black biases of our society ? feed it.""

The lays the bias and prejudice of these systems at the feet of ""coders"" and presumes that more skillful programming can resolve the problems. But the issue is far more insidious than that. 

The data the AI system learns from comes from the reported experiences of police officers with the population they serve. So no matter how well programmed the system is, it will reflect biases, perceptions, experiences of those who generated the data. 

Another subtle effect which no one talks about is the purchasing process itself. How will the police department judge if the system is well designed and effective? By subjecting the system results to comparison to existing results which are generated by the same people it's supposed to assist?

Machine learning is a freakishly powerful tool for duplicating the patterns of human decision making only. Furthermore, the technology puts a patina of objectivity, precision, and inerrancy on  machine judgments that don't deserve it.

In a situation like policing that relies on human judgement, all machine learning does is make the same flawed life, death, and liberty decisions faster, more efficient, and far more inscrutable. "
15,"I have heard of Bayesian statistical methods for identifying spam in Mozilla's Seamonkey and Thunderbird email programs, which work by the user selecting which mails are spam and letting the program figure out what the characteristics of a spam message are. There presumably is no preconception of what a spam message is, only the traits that are collected in the ""training"" file as the user marks mail as spam or not-spam. This would seem to be a more fair way to analyze criminal vs noncriminal activity except for the fact that some parts of town receive more policing than others, and officers are known to use approaches that turn innocuous situations into hostile ones in which a crime may be provoked. If the same statistical methods could be used to identify bad cops who provoke situations and display a pattern of prejudice in their actions, and that bad-cop pattern could be used for terminations, Bayesian statistical methods might make policing more fair."
16,"As the writer states, These new A.I. capabilities process data, existing data, that we know are biased or skewed. The tools produce models that could help, but where is the oversight on how these models are produced? Where is there human input to correct biases in the data due to heaver policing and greater prosecution rates for minorities? Otherwise we continue to propagate prejudice."
17,"How does police enforcement action skew data on crimes like homicide, robbery, grand larceny and burglary? All these crimes require complainants and victims unlike drug offenses where a police officer is usually the complaining witness. Are the police being too aggressive in enforcing the murder laws in some communities thereby tainting the data?"
18,"I would posit that AI, as the author describes it, is faithfully perpetuating the main purpose of most police forces, namely keeping the black community disenfranchised and disempowered so that the white community feels safe.  How else can we explain the broad expectation in white American society that black citizens should have so much less than white citizens, suffer so much more invasion, incarceration, and incapacitation and yet be complacent about it and not seek redress through other than peaceful means.  The white community's response when feeling aggrieved is to act out of hatred and elect a President Trump to tear it all down.  Knowing this, the white community acts to keep a lid on the black community by means of the police state."
19,"I refer you to Karl Menninger's ""The Crime of Punishment.""  Punitive justice systems just don't work."
20,"We saw Congresswoman Karen Bass, a California Democrat, press Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, III, our present, Russian connected Attorney General about a recent FBI report that described ?Black Identity Extremists? as a possible terrorist threat to the United States and domestic law enforcement agencies.

The term ?Black Identity Extremists? seems to have been invented by the FBI for that report, along with the fact that the FBI itself has a well-documented, historical proclivity for fomenting discord in black communities and for creating racially-biased strategies and narratives against African-Americans, e.g., Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Black Panthers. 

Ms. Williams is correct in her concerns. The white led propaganda apparatus must end and be neutralized in order to achieve a more perfect union between our citizenry. "
21,"I came to the comments section to ask about the inclusion of moon phases in prediction software, which strikes me as very interesting. But the number of trolls in the comments is sickeningly astounding. Those of you implying (or flat out stating) that the author is a bad parent for being black and living in a predominantly black city, you disgust me. It must be lovely to be so in denial of the effects of historical discrimination on African-American communities and the results of bias in policing and sentencing that your mind is literally unable to process the basic premise of this article. Here is a re-statement: although data suggests white and black Americans commit crimes at the same rates, blacks are historically policed and jailed at higher rates and for longer, harsher sentences. Therefore using historical data to inform policing replicates those problems. This is clearly problematic. Go scream about black-on-black crime somewhere else (or, preferably, don't. No one is in favor of street crime, but most people understand that being killed by a mugger is categorically different than being killed by a policeman who is legally bound to protect you)."
22,"Come on.  Give me a break.  Blacks account for 50% of all homicides.  Does racism cause blacks to kill each other in disproportionate numbers?  I suppose AI also unjustly profiles males compared to females.

First the complaint is that the police are biased.  When statistical techniques don't seem to reduce the alleged bias, then the statistical techniques must be criticized.  It's worth quoting Denzel Washington's response to a question about the state of Black America:

?Well, it starts in the home. If the father is not in the home, the boy will find a father in the streets. I saw it in my generation and every generation before me and every one since.? He added, ?If the streets raise you, then the judge becomes your mother and prison becomes your home.?"

24,"Racial ""profiling"" exists because blacks are disproportionately more likely to be criminals as well as crime victims.

It's as simple as that."
25,"As a builder of buildings, President Trump is a realist.  He knows that the Palestinians aren't serious about negotiating a peace beginning from a time 70 years ago when they and several Arab nations turned down their own state and tried to destroy Israel.

Thanks to the 1967 attempt of Egypt, Syria and Jordan to destroy Israel during the Six-Day War, Israel was able to reunify Jerusalem.  

When Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza in 2006, the Palestinians elected a terrorist organization (according to US, Israel and the EU), Hamas, to lead them.  A Palestinian civil war ensued with many Palestinian deaths.  Instead of building up a democracy, Hamas chose to initiate several wars with Israel by launching missiles into Israel.  So many missiles, that Israel had to create the ""Iron Dome"" anti-missile system to protect civilians.

If the Palestinians really want peace, the need to have the new democratic elections that they should have had in 2010, 4 years after the 2006 elections.  They need to elect a parliament and a President that after 70 years is realistic and really wants to serve its population by negotiating a realistic peace agreement.

Israel now joins the all the other nations of the world in having its capital, a capital first created 3,000 years ago, recognized by the United States of America.

Thank you President Trump."
26,"I think that unrest/violence/war are great distractions when you, your Administration and your family are hurling towards ruin. "
27,"Trump is wrong again. King David (1000 BC) was the first to rule Judea from Jerusalem. When his son King Solomon died, the kingdom split creating Israel to the north and Judea to the south.  Jerusalem remained the capitol of Judea and the capitol of Israel was Samaria. 	"
28,"Here is the reality check and it's an ugly one. It does not matter what Trump or anyone else does in regards to this issue. Sadly, there will never be a negotiated peace between Israel and Palestine. Both believe their respective ownership rights are rooted in religious doctrine and when it comes to religious ideas, very few concessions are made.  That?s why, as ugly as it sounds, there will most likely never be peace. Palestine is too weak, Muslim world is too divided, Israel thanks to United States is strong and empowered. Does anyone honestly think that lands for which people have died for, shed blood for can be returned at the negotiation table? Mothers lost sons and daughters for these lands, no one will ever return it for ?peace?. You want to take territory, you have to fight for it, that?s it. Palestine is too weak to do that so this ?peace? charade will continue. Ten, twenty years from now, players will change, new parties, presidents, will take over. The game though? That will stay the same.  In the end just regular folks suffer. Palestinian children with no future, Israeli citizens who endure random attacks and the innocents around the world at the mercy of various terrorist organizations who use this issue as the main recruiting point. God help us all. "
29,"Why is it assumed that peace is the goal? It seems clear that the actual intent is to stir the pot and increase turbulence in the region.

However,the President has honoured the 1995 congressional decision to shift the Embassy to Jerusalem.It reaffirms his faith in his people & their wishes.
From Moses to Maimonides to Trump,the history of Israel will have an name added to its beleaguered but chequered history:Donald John Trump.

31,"   Trump is a dangerous hypocrite, unhinged, with malicious intent to cause harm and confusion. How long can such a beast be allowed to abuse the power of the presidency is anyone's guess, but the longer his misrule is allowed, the less credible will the United States be in it's assertions of seeking peace in society, national and internationally. But then again, previous secretaries of state said the obvious, that the U.S. has no friends, just interests. A sad appraisal of human relations, 'rotten' tribal feelings of trust and support towards each other. How low can we go, given we are in the toilet already? Are we going to ignore the Palestinians, as we have the Rohingya, the Yemenis and other forgotten victims of our warmongering...and 'interests'?"

34,"The combined report of six very perceptive journalists spells out a rather complicated future for all three countries involved.  However, the photograph by Atef Safad showing a heavily armed Israeli police force in the Old City and the photo by Mohammed Salem of a more reserved Palestinian demonstration burning an American flag really tells the story.

As ill-advised as Trump?s play may seem and the exchange may be non-existent, there seems to be very little of a gamble at stake. 

Violent repercussions by the Arab states will probably be nothing more than invectives but a long-lasting hatred for America is a certainty. 

The photograph of the flag-burning is an image that always amazes: It shows a young man dressed in the latest fashion styles established by young Americans?designer cap (turned backwards), slim jeans and very slick hoodie and vest (probably all made in China).

The hip-hop generation protested America but never hated America.  How deep can a hatred go when you want to look like the people you think you hate?"
35,"How sad....
We have so lowered our standards and expectations. We are so concerned with the reaction on the streets of Ramallah that we will not concede the painfully obvious. Why are the Palestinians so angry? Is ANYONE suggesting that their claim to East Jerusalem is up for discussion? The street is angry because of recognition of WEST Jerusalem. With the exception of the extreme radical left, there is nobody even remotely suggesting that West Jerusalem is up for negotiation. With the exception of the extreme right, nobody (not even Netanyahu) is suggesting that East Jerusalem will be annexed. This statement causes no real change in the status quo. THAT is the problem- nothing will placate the Palestinians until the entire state (sans Jews) is theirs. East Jerusalem, West Jerusalem, Haifa, Beer Sheva and Tel Aviv.  Kineret sea to the Mediterranean sea. The whole kit and kaboodle.
Trump may be a boor and an idiot, but he does see through the political rhetoric because he could care less about niceties and correctness. This recognition has ALWAYS been obvious and the right thing to do- Trump is the first president who could care less about the fallout."

39,"This might be ""telling it like it is"" to Palestinians, but it is also punching down from the Bully-In-Chief.

Rather than negotiate, dictate.
I don't think anyone is going to ""get over it."" How do you negotiate when the most radical on both sides of the issue refuse the existence of the other? All the Israelis can hope for is a large population of second-class citizens they can't fully trust; with this move from the US, all the Palestinians can hope for is continued harassment, ethnic cleansing, or apartheid.
All Trump is doing is removing hope for the Palestinians; and a people without hope is a sad and dangerous thing."
40,"Trump will support a two-state solution ""if agreed to by both sides."" But the only two-state solution Israel will accept would have to include its annexation of East Jerusalem and the territory on which it has planted illegal settlements. The Palestinians would be left with scraps of land, and of course their sovereignty over even this would be compromised because of Israeli ""security concerns.""

Such a plan, which amounts to creating a Palestinian Bantustan, would of course be acceptable to the Israelis, to American Zionists, and to Trump -- who after all admires Andrew Jackson, the president who dealt with the Indians in basically the same way he (Trump) wants to deal with the Palestinians. The Palestinians will never accept such a plan, of course, but it's being implemented on the ground in any case. This is unjust, and the people responsible, in Israel and the United States, will one day pay a price for their actions.   "
41,"RE: ?There is a push to redraw the boundaries of Jerusalem to eject much of its Arab population and add tens of thousands of residents to Israeli settlements.?

It?s important to point out that?s exactly what happened in 1947 and 1949, except that it happened to the (majority) Jewish population. 

In 1947, the U.N. proposed having the borders of  the Jewish capital redrawn, taken out of the hands of, the about to be re-established, state of Israel, and turned into an internationally administered city, with open access to all holy sites by members of all religions. Israel agreed to this in exchange for their right to re-establish their nation in their homeland. The Arabs disagreed as this would allow the Jews to remain in Jerusalem.

In 1949, Jordan occupied Jerusalem and exiled all of the Jews from their capital. During the previous quarter century, 500,000 Arabs from neighboring countries immigrated to ?Jewish Palestine ? Land of Israel?, while the Jews  were severely limited in their ability to return to their homeland. During the 19 year occupation of Jerusalem, Judea & Samaria, Jews were denied access to their holy sites. It was only after the re-unification of the Jerusalem that Jews were able to return to their capital. It was only after control Jerusalem, was returned to Israel, were all religions granted free access to all the holy sites.

Even if it can be justified, it?s unlikely #Israel will do to Arabs what the Arabs did to the Jews."
42,"Trump makes decisions to attract attention to himself and to enlarge his ego, that is how a pathological narcissist deals with the world. The consequences couldn't be more damaging. US foreign policy is being reduced to a stage for Trump's pompous, vacuous, vain ego to tell the World ""Look at me, I am important."" Writing his enormous signature and displaying it for the news was the greatest thrill Trump, the monstrous egotist, got out of moving the embassy to Jerusalem. This seemingly trivial fact is almost too horrific to be true, but it is. If Heinrich Himmler was a prime example of the banality of evil, Trump is the paragon of the banality of childish egotism. This is far worse than it sounds - Evil Himmler didn't have nukes, Immoral Trump does."
43,Moving the embassy there ensures American retaliation on any missile attack on it by Hezbollah on Jerusalem. Not so smart Mr. Trump.

Anybody who takes the bait and believes that this is about the ""historic capital of the Jewish people"" is a complete rube. This is about shoring up Trump's base and that's it. 

Trump is doing that under conditions of duress. The observation by Republican political advisor, Alex Castellanos, that ""we're closer to impeachment now than we think"" is not without merit. Castellanos feels that the combination of the Mueller investigation and the prospective election of Roy Moore next week will create a collective albatross that will cost the GOP control of the House and the Senate in 2018. 

Political figures are almost always the potential butt of jokes and caricatures but the level of legitimate acrimony towards this administration expressed on late night television and other venues is both staggering and unparalleled.

Furthermore I find it tragic Congress, Trump are not supporting CHIP that cares for 9 million American children , yet are happy to subsidize Israel to the tune of $3.5 billion , a country that has universal health care that cares for all its children.

46,"There was no ""United States? longstanding role as a mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"" for us to lose.   The US has been an indefatigable supporter of Israel and no more a force for peace in the region than Kim Jong Un has been for peace in the Pacific.   We have instead been a long running stage manager of the decades long Kabuki performance that pretends to be peace negotiations.  The goal of successive Israeli administrations has been to create facts-on-the-ground that prevent either one-state or two-state solutions, and that keep Palestinians in servitude.  I confess I have no specific suggestions to offer.  There is evil going on in Palestine and we the people of the US are just standing by and watching it unfold - and our gov't is complicit."

50,"I think humility is required when commenting on a society that's not your own, even when backed up by a good New York Times article. But I must admit that I don't understand the French obsession with stamping out headscarves. Many women around the world who are not religious zealots wear headscarves. French people who see headscarves will not turn into Moslems. They're really not that fragile, as they have repeatedly demonstrated.<br/><br/>There's a big difference between a head scarf and a burka. The face of someone wearing a head scarf is visible. She's can be a full and responsive participant in public life. With a burka, the face is obscured and the woman really can't be part of a public conversation. You can be a perfectly good doctor in a head scarf, but not in a burka. To me, the question on religious clothing is whether it intereferes with a person's ability to participate in public life. If yes, the state has a legitimate interest in regulating it, if no, it doesn't."

We saw how well that worked out. So why do we think that it would work any differently in France? It won't work. It hasn't worked.<br/><br/>Nations, religions and ethnic groups still matter. Sometimes it feels good to imagine that they don't. But they do. Like any other nation France has a right to prefer and maintain its own culture, to remain French in other words.

The insistence on secular behaviour and non-religious dress when publicly visible in France, including leaving a Muslim (or Christian) schoolgirl?s head and face uncovered, is a double-edged sword.<br/><br/>The burqini ban meant to enforce one egalitarian standard for all girls and women could lead some ­Muslims ­to believe that it curtails a ­woman?s rights to self-expression. Beyond that, there is risk of alienating Muslims in the urban West and girding the loins of young minds to justify more acts of violence. By itself, the complete ­coverage of Muslim women is not convincingly associated with jihadist terrorist attacks. Women in the Middle East have voluntarily or under social duress worn some form of body covering for generations and ­incited no systematic violence.<br/><br/>It is far more important to study how Muslim youth are being radicalized at home and in religious schools by such bans. The imposition of culturally ­neutral lifestyles in the public domain are not going to sway young minds towards secular humanism. Coercing Muslims to eat, drink, and dress like proper Frenchmen and women could further inflame terrorist sentiment. Instead of expert opinions, lets assess more rigorous social policy research as the lives of nascent terrorists and their victims are at stake. "
53,"Look to epidemiology and public health for some thinking tools.  Host, agent, environment, vector.  Public health addresses all of these components in its efforts to contain and eradicate disease.  Think of terror as disease, at this point.    Who are the susceptibles (hosts?).  Can they be made healthier, immunized?  What is the environment?  Can it be made inhospitable to the agent or vector?    It is not helpful to say Islam is the disease.  The VAST majority of Muslims are opposed to terror and believe that Islam has nothing at all to do with terror--it is the very opposite of terror.  <br/><br/>We define the disease incorrectly when we identify Islam or ""Muslims"" as the disease agent."
54,"Many Western intellectuals argue that France's policy of ""laicism"" alienates its Muslim community and makes their youth more vulnerable to radicalism.<br/>What I do not see are the counter-arguments postulating that the persecution of Christian minorities in Islamic majority countries may be a factor in the rising fear and mistrust of Islam in the West. "
55,"I'm glad that the times at least is starting to publish more balanced takes on Islam. This is the same paper that has had countless tone deaf denunciations of the ""burkini ban"" and ""islamophobia"".<br/>This, on the day when isis once more attacks Coptic churches in Egypt, which also had been a Christian nation before being invaded by the arabs. (France and the US should take note)<br/>Liberals need to stop blaming colonialism and giving socioeconomic excuses for jihadist attacks. Do Hindus and Buddhists bomb and murder their former colonial overlords? No, the problem is clearly within Islam itself. The rise of salafism and Saudi Wahhabism in the last few decades has been the main trigger for the rise in terror. Otherwise we would see poor, young, unemployed men of all races and religions committing beheadings to lash out against their unfair lot in life. But this does not occur.<br/>Unfortunately the solution must come from a secular revivalism within Islam. I say unfortunately because I do not see this happening any time soon. Many so-called peaceful Muslims are quick to complain about islamophobia, but still support shariah law. (This is borne out by polls done by Pew.)<br/>We need to support and encourage those brave Muslims that are trying to reform their religion for good, but these are too few and too threatened."
56,"Interesting that there are so few comments. This column is clearly too balanced and fair for the rabid Left but it is so sane it is unable to froth! By all means ban religion and call yourselves tolerant. This man is right. There's a problem of survival here and we ignore it not just at western peril but to the peril of all non-radical thought and belief. The elevation of radical Islam into a victimized minority may, as it has before, bring power to the left but it will also destroy it. We are fools to host our own enemy, the enemy of pluralism so many have fought and died for. Anyone who thanks we can tolerate people who laugh at, deride and despise our foundational belief in the freedom of individual worth is delusional. This is definitely a time when ""it's not working (tolerance of the intolerable) so we need more of it"",  is western civilization suicide. No need for jihadis, we'll do ourselves in."
57,"The US starts with the view that ""all men are created equal"" and does not favor any particular religion or tradition, as an aspirational goal. That works, when backed up by law and supported by assimilation programs. This approach also works well in Canada, where Muslim (and other) immigrants assimilate relatively easily. <br/><br/>The French will continue to have problems with Muslim assimilation if ghettoes are allowed to fester. The only alternative to active assimilation is to give these stranded communities incentive to go back where they came from, which is impractical. The alternative is for France to wither like Japan, and risk becoming just a quaint travel destination with aging population and declining vitality.  "
58,"France's idea of liberty is incomplete, so it sometimes promotes subtle oppression. One example is the absurdity of its bans on ""excessive"" public religious dress. This is no reason for the rising Islamism in its midst. After all, there is no rising radical Catholisicm. More accurately: it just gives Islamic sociopaths a convenient and undeserved excuse. Focus on countering the truly oppressive ideas, not the personal wardrobe. That preserves liberty."
59,"Both Roy and Kepel have compelling points of view, however, still at the heart of the terrorist problem is religion.  You can make compelling arguments against someone?s political point of view and perhaps persuade the person to change that viewpoint, but arguing with  someone about his or her deeply held religious beliefs, which have become a large part of that person's life, is far more difficult.  The problem has not been solvable since the Crusades.<br/>When people become foreigners in their own country despite being born there due to profoundly held religious beliefs that incubate hate toward those who are not of the same faith, they become a danger to society.  I am a liberal, but have been troubled by  both radical Christians and Muslims, which in some respects are opposite sides of the same coin.  Those who practice the radical form of both faiths have similar negative views towards women, homosexuals, and those whose faith does not correspond with their own deeply held religious beliefs.  Further, the radicals in both faiths want their beliefs imposed on society as a whole through law.   Radical Christians in this country pose a danger to progressive changes in society such as woman's right to choose and gay marriage.  Radicalized Muslims pose a physical danger.  The same is true elsewhere.  There are no clear answers as to why our (mostly) young Muslim men are becoming radicalized.  None. What makes someone who once seemed to be your friend want to take your life?"

61,"Why doesn't  the article point out the real source of this spreading ""Salafism"" i.e. the Wahhabi branch of islam that is the national religion of Saudi Arabia.  The article also fails to discuss the billions the Saudi's have spent spreading this medieval, intollerant Salafism around the Islamic world via Mosques, Madrasa, and money--probably into the very communities now producing these Jihadists.  The ""Gulf states"" are also arming and funding the Jihadists that led to ISIS and al Qaeda.<br/>All over the Islamic world Wahhabi preachers, along with Saudi money have turned once tolerant Sunni communities into intolerant centers of hatred for Modernity, Shia's, Druse, Christians and all others.  This is why they are called Takfiri--they refuse to recognize the legitimacy of any other form of belief.<br/>""What changed, he said, was not primarily the advances of the racist National Front, but the spread of Gulf-sponsored Salafism."""

65,"1. Good grief, such a long article and so little comprehension of the problem with Islam. The writer, like so many who dare to write about Islam without any knowledge of it, confuse Islam with Moslems. This is a fundamental error in logic. <br/><br/>The only way to understand what is going on with Islam is to recognize that Islam is the belief system and Moslems are people who identify with the belief system but do not necessarily practice it the way they are supposed to practice it. <br/><br/>Islam is the Koran plus the sacred sayings of Muhammad. Those do not come in different versions; they are neither radical or moderate. They are what they are, and they are taught and preached in every mosque. Moslems, on the other hand, follow the belief system to differing degrees. Some follow the sacred jihadist commands of Islam, and many Moslems don't. "
66,"Here is an equally impressive article about another scholar of Islam who sees the threat that others refuse to see:  <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-islams-most-eloquent-apostate-1491590469"" title=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-islams-most-eloquent-apostate-1491590469"" target=""_blank"">https://www.wsj.com/articles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-islams-most-eloquent-aposta...</a>"
67,"I just want to point out that this effort to get at root causes only ever runs in one direction. No one doubts the political and economic justifications that people give for their behavior. When someone says, ?Listen, I murdered my rich neighbor because I knew he kept a pile of money in a safe. I wanted that money, and I didn?t want to leave a witness,? nobody looks for an ulterior explanation for that behavior. But when someone says, ?I think infidels and apostates deserve to burn in hell, and I know for a fact that I?ll go to paradise if I die while waging jihad against them,? many academics refuse to accept this rationale at face value and begin looking for the political or economic reasons that they imagine lie beneath it. So the game is rigged.<br/><br/>There are many examples of educated, affluent young men joining organizations like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State who lack any discernible material or political grievances. They simply feel a tribal connection to Muslims everywhere, merely because they share the same religious identity. We are seeing jihadis travel halfway around the world for the privilege of dying in battle who have nothing in common with the beleaguered people of Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, or Somalia whose ranks they are joining, apart from a shared belief in the core doctrines of Islam.<br/>~Sam Harris"
68,"Islamophobia is a misnomer. By definition a phobia is an irrational fear. Anyone that knows the history of Islam knows better. The only time Islam hasn't warred with the rest of the world is when they know the odds are stacked against them. But they wait, patiently. If the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful why are they so unsuccessful in persuading the small minority of their (pick your term) Salafist, radicalized, fundamentalist, jihadist brethren towards moderation?<br/>There's hardly a Muslim majority country in the world that is a bastion of rationality, living peacefully in ways that would be acceptable to your average Westerner. Most of northern Africa is comprised of completely failed countries. Indonesia has long been held as an example of a functioning moderate Muslim country (the world's most populous country). But that's changing quickly, even that country has taken a sharp turn towards fundamentalism recently.<br/>Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran. Need one mention Syria? The only countries not ravaged are those ruthlessly governed by autocratic governments like most of the oil rich Gulf countries.<br/>It's a shame when one sees pictures from Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, and other Muslims countries from decades ago. They wore Western fashions (women too) and had as progressive and curious minds as any society. Amazing how quickly it all went sour.<br/>We may not be at war with them but they're at war with us. Wait until climate change advances, we ain't seen nothing yet."
69,"Without the so-called Human Rights, we wouldn't have all this mess. The Human Rights are used against French of native stocks. Today, they even help foreigners to get rights that French don't even have, like for instance the money they give to any refugee each month while a French who is his own entrepreneur and meets regularly overcharging fees from the RSI (Tax-Centre for Independent) has no right at all when he throws the towel due to these debts (in order to finance all the social rights that himself/herself has no right for). So, many come in France and in many West-European countries just because they can receive social benefits without any duty and with a better quality of life than at their homes. It's like only the French ignore the superb quality of their land, but the fault is the Human Rights that brainwash every people during the school teaching them that they're no more French citizens but citizens of the world. So, it's no more their country but the country of anyone. And anyone is entitled to claim its part of land and bring his own values, even those that are opposite to the freedom of the masses. It's like people were ignoring the crimes that were committed in many Islamic countries and like all these people, soon after having passed the EU border, would become all equal even though some of them obviously had purported some Islamic crimes that even the NYT reports regularly in their country. Of course, they brought their customs with them ! Who's naïve ?"
70,"In the mid-Eighties the Socialists were trying to improve the conditions of the newly arrived (60's) Muslim French. From 1990, Chirac (and later, Sarkozy) with the National Front gaining ground as the post-WWII economic boom fizzled, soon followed by globalization, employed the scapegoating of the ""other"" for electoral gain. Minority housing and schooling were totally neglected as the French state engaged in a policy of repression of the Muslim Minority.<br/>Kepel, child of privileged Jewish immigrants, ignores these facts."
71,"A country cannot expect much when it treats a large segment of a minority as second-rate citizens for three generations. No one can claim France did its part in helping their French of N African descent assimilate.<br/>In fact, this mis-treatment has driven many back to their religion for refuge."
72,"This was a very insightful and interesting article - though this made me giggle: ""once guided by the paternalist figures from the old country known as darons"". It makes them sound like tutelary mystics from Planet K. Daron is the slang word for parent and you don't have to be Muslim to use it; they're not from the old country or paternalistic or anything else. Many people under the age of 25 living in the suburbs say ""daron"" and ""daronne"" for their parents, including on occasion my own kids. "

74,"As with most complex issues, everyone has a piece of the truth. The poverty, racism and ""second class"" citizenship of the muslim population certainly must be addressed. However, Kepel's thesis (one shared by many secularists and moderate muslims) is that the salafist version of Islam is very, very amenable to use in justifying  violence. Much of the liberal left has wrongly conflated an attack on this fundamentalist ideology with a racist attack on muslims as a group. People are privileged, ideas are not."

76,"What a miss!  Just a regurgitation of popular music memes.  There's a major resurgence of progressive metal and not a single mention.  I'm referring to amazing and complex works by serious virtuoso musicians like Animals As Leaders, Plini, The Helix Nebula, Intervals, I Built the Sky, Scale the Summit and even the popular/easily accessible favorite Periphery.  These aren't your kids' screamo bands but rather serious musicians who are advancing the genre of heavy and complex polyphonic music.  While 'popular music' critics dismiss anything with the label 'metal' as related to 80's Motley Crue, the bands I'm referring to have more in common with Mozart and jazz than what's commonly considered 'metal' by those who don't really understand the breadth of the genre.  The musicianship and compositional skills of the leaders of this genre surpass that of 'popular' music to the degree that they may be hard to comprehend by non-musician listeners.  Arpeggiated and polyphonic melodies in odd or shifting time signatures are likely beyond the understanding and appreciation of critics, unless they are accomplished musicians themselves.  Nevertheless, there's a world of complex music that most people are missing, partially due to the ignorance and simplicity of critics and their inability to consider or understand anything beyond 'popular' music."
77,"Well I tried. The future of music? So I listened to Future. What I heard: a 2 bar sample repeated throughout without variation. A simple factory preset beat repeated throughout with variation.

78,Honestly because music has a variety of genres it's hard to say which artist is the future of music.You can't necessarily give them that title if it does not pertain to their genre.Today music sounds so similar the uniqueness is being lost ...because with the new technology anyone or an song can sound like its good especially with a good producer.
79,"The real questions are  ""Whose music, and whose tastes?"".<br/>Certainly not mine, not those of any of the people I associate with (varied and wide-ranging). Seems to me that any music that is pop, rap, ""world""music is included in the NYT definition.Not much else.<br/>How about keeping this to an article instead of a whole issue? It's doubtful, anyway, that many of those who listen to this music read the NYT or read at all."
80,"Dear New York Times Magazine (and other magazines),<br/><br/>When you devote an entire issue to a single subject, as with the coverage of twenty-five (pop) songs in the March 12 issue, you lose readers who have no interest in that subject.

When I discovered that, aside from the puzzles, today?s magazine had none of its other features, I threw it out.<br/>	I understand that devoting a large part of the magazine to a single topic allows you to cover it in more depth, but with the internet, you have another option: keep a variety of stories in the print issue and publish the deep analyses online."

It doesn't purport the songs as ""the best new music"" or artists as ""most talented musicians"".  As a high school teacher, I can tell you many of these picks are spot-on based on what my students are listening to. You may not like it (I personally am not a fan of drone rap), but crying about ""how they used to play instruments"" also misses the point of the piece.<br/><br/>3) Many of the negative comments show an implicit bias against black artists.

Stephen King actually called McMurtry the ""truest, fiercest songwriter of his generation."" <br/><br/>For those bemoaning the lack of country music here, McMurtry writes raw honest songs about the American heartland where he grew up. His songs have been covered by country legends like Robert Earl Keen and Ray Wylie Hubbard, and his first album was produced by longtime fan John Cougar Mellencamp. He writes all his own material and he's incredible live, bringing his show to some of the most oft-ignored corners of ""flyover country."" For those of you talking about Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits (two of my favorites as well), I'm pretty sure you'll like McMurtry too. <br/><br/>Google him. Listen to Choctaw Bingo. Scroll to 15.

Discrimination against any minority is clearly wrong and tech bro's need enlightening.  But, the growing ""(a woman) My victim story of a world without complete gender parity..."" is often just lazy journalism."
106,"Why don't we talk about college enrollment - 60/40 in female favor? Why do we still have female-only colleges and no male-only colleges? Boys face much higher bar getting into STEM oriented Unis these days - look at the gender-split acceptance rates at MIT, Caltech, Harvey Mud and others."
107,Not until men start suing their employers for being lesser paid than women will there be relatively true employment equality.
108,"In /insert the estimate of your best calculation/ years it will be laughable that for a brief time in human history we had to sell our time on this planet to survive.  If you are young, recalculate. If you are old, learn to crochet, a unmachinable art still. Eventually you will have a large enough piecework to cover that living room window."
109,I find it sad that each new generation still produces  so many young men who think it is OK to harass women. Even with laws and policies in companies they still treat women as objects and servants.
110,"The fact that women make less compared to the male dollar earned, I think it is about .75, says a lot. As if women pay less for food, rent, cars and other expenses. Women have to work longer and harder just to survive in general."
111,"The attacks on the author, Pao, do not change the the observations of discriminatory work environments. In her lawsuit, documents and witnesses offered undisputed evidence of women being propositioned by superiors and decisions not to include women entrepreneurs in networking outings as females would change the vibe.
Let's devote more effort to addressing the pipeline problem-- not as many females are majoring in computer science or tech fields. Girls at earlier ages need to be encouraged in programming camps and activities. Schools need to be more supportive of females in STEM. When there are more women excelling in classrooms and workplaces, much of the hostile environment will diminish. As barriers have been decreased, women have become well-represented and leaders in medicine. Let's make them more well-represented and leaders in tech."
112,Has anything really changed for Ellen Pao?
113,Still whining about coming out on the short end of her shakedown (uhmmm. I mean lawsuit). Move on.
114,"Tech veterans know all of these companies in the news as lousy places to work, not only for women, LGBQT, people of color, etc.  

They're easy to ID - in place of professionals working quietly solving customer problems, you have slippy slides and Friday beer bashes.  In place of offices or cubicles, you have couches and foosball tables.  Instead of ""We've been very lucky,"" you hear ""We're the smartest people ever!""  Rather than a great career and a decent chance to strike it big, you hear about world domination and killing the enemy.

If you want that good career and a decent chance to strike it big, do some careful listening and make some grown-up decisions."
115,"I managed my first IT department in 1985 and since then I have worked in tech with dozens of companies either as a full-time employee or as a consultant. I've worked with hundreds, if not thousands, of techies. So I see this over a longer period than Ellen, who is looking at 5 years. I'm looking at 30, and I can say without doubt that women are much better represented in tech today than they were in the 80's. There is still a long way to go to reach parity, however, things ARE getting better and I hope that no woman will be dissuaded from going into technology because of Pao's continual doom reporting.

When I started out a common complaint I heard, and then observed myself, was about not being heard in meetings. Men would talk over them, take credit for their ideas, etc. It was true and I always went out of my way to ensure the women in my teams were heard, often to the chagrin of the males on the team.

Things are improving, please go into tech, stand your ground, speak your mind, be assertive and don't let men hold you back. There is tremendous opportunity for you to develop a career that you love and respect that you deserve."
116,The Apple corporation seems to have opted out of the discriminatory loop that Ms. Pao outlines. Tim Cook as top leader has been exemplary in this regard.  Ms Pao could have acknowledged this. 
117,"So what percentage of engineers and computer science majors are women?

Data for 2015 shows both are under 20% for women.

So part of women being underrepresented at companies like Google and Facebook is that fact that women are a small percentage of the talent pool.
The other reason is old boy sexism in the management ranks which must change to improve the quality of the workforce.  The ex CEO of Uber needs to have some daughters and then think about his handling of women employees and hopefully grow up.

A Dad with three daughters and two boys!"
118,"My research assistant and I were talking this past week about the field of engineering,  I told her how, 30 years ago at the start of my career, I got good at answering the question ""What is it like being a woman engineer?"" My practiced response: ""The only difference is I keep getting asked that question."" 

She burst into laughter signaling camaraderie. I asked her, ""What? Do they still ask that question?"" She nodded and said, ""Oh, yes. They still do."""
119,"Inspiring call to arms.  I suggest that our ""surrogate life"" workplaces are not healthy; and individually, we should maintain good ""worker relationships"", not more.

Lead, company, lead!  Be efficient during work hours and ensure that workers' lives outside work hours are valued as PRIVATE and rewarding.

Worker, this means you!  See your co-worker as a daughter or son of a parent who said ""No, you may not date"".  

With that environment and mindset, supervisor can more effectively train, observe, and discipline by the book.  Plus, dutiful oversight up the line.

White-collar, blue-collar: Git'er done, so we can pursue the things we need: living wage, paid vacation time, portable health insurance.  The vision of the future can no longer be a rat race.

Then, win with companies that share success and the labor-exploiting companies must reform.  All progress hinges on workplaces for grown-ups that Ms Pao envisions.  Let's get there because Ladies and Gentlemen: ""The transformation of the rat race demands our undivided attention""."
120,"It is great that there are women willing to speak up and fight for equity in the work place in the tech industry, and increasing focus on rape and sexual harassment of female university students. That said, I get really tired of this focus on professional, university educated women. What about the rest of the women and girls out there, who work in blue-collar jobs that don't require a college education? They often have little or no protection and from sexual harassment and even rape, and usually do not make enough to hire a decent lawyer. I would really appreciate some articles about the status of MOST working women, and not just the privileged few. "
121,A truly able person is always threat. Women like Ellen throw away any chance of integration into the organization of their choosing by submitting to whatever is required.  It's hardly worth the intellectual prostration required to maintain it.  Unless you are focused only on the monetary reward it's a fairly low quality form of life. 
122,"Let?s not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see. We could be stuck in an unfair loop indefinitely.

She's a poet don't she know it."
123,"If you are a woman and want to succeed in tech then start your own company, succeed, make it a point of hiring only or mostly women and then be sued for discrimination. Don't use Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos as your primary role models. Don't wear black turtlenecks and jeans. Do the really hard stuff, raw computer sciences, programming, AI, etc and be at the very forefront of your field. Be a true innovator. In school, do not major in marketing, economics, business, law or any other ancillary, supporting field.  Take huge risks, be willing to fail miserably and risk millions of dollars in loans that investors hold you responsible for. Stop complaining about the past and present. Look to the future  and get started."
124,"As an educator in a 4-year college environment for 31 years, I find overwhelming evidence to suggest that female students outperform males on many dimensions of learning and competency-demonstration that matter in classrooms.  But there is a much larger world out there that is addressed by macro-economic and other evidence.  

The problem with the frequency distribution (achievement and gender distribution) - as Larry Summers pointed out to a politically motivated and intellectually vacuous audience and paid an unfair price for - lies in the tails.

There is a reason more men are in jail than women.  Males are nuts; we think we can get away with it - and when we are poor and of the wrong race, we don't.  There is a reason that more men win Nobel prizes.  Males are nuts, we take the kind of risks necessary to get there.  

The causes are entirely societal and cultural.  Not genetic.  Not gender related.

If nothing has changed, then we are collectively acting out some really dumb socio-cultural scripts - exactly in the way Neanderthals did before they became extinct.  So will we if we keep this up.

125,"I would be hesitant to teach anything regarding the actual protest and fight because my knowledge and understanding of what actually happened (5 Ws) is pretty limited. Teaching something I don't really understand, especially a hot button issue with strong emotion on all sides, seems less than judicious.
     But it's a good opportunity to discuss 1st amendment issues and the complex role of the media, social and regular."
126,"Thanks so much for providing this clearinghouse of resources. I intend to use some of them in my 9th grade advisory. It was clear from discussions with my students at the beginning of the year that Charlottesville had made a major impact, and for most of them, a very frightening impact. The best way to deal with that is having all the facts and learning what they can do to counter the Trump-inspired racist upsurge our country is experiencing."
127,"In my childhood home, my verbally abusive father loved my clinically depressed mother but continuously berated her;  ""don't be such a putz, Estelle,"" was a phrase I heard at least 15 times a day.  

I went into psychotherapy in my early 20s with the aim of unlearning, and repairing the damage from what I had experienced.  It took a while and it was a difficult process but it worked.  

I do not believe males are born with a gene that predisposes them to disrespect women.  I believe it is learned behavior.  It starts at home, in childhood.  Like almost everything else.  To wit, my adult son reveres and respects women.  And my daughter believes that she can be as successful as she wants to be. 

I am saddened by the author's column.  I wish her and all her female colleagues the best of luck. "
128,"I am raising my boys to be aware of the sexism and gender discrimination. However, men in power continue to downplay women's roles even when seen in positions of power.  I am a strong person with a strong morale compass and can think of three main incidents in my career when I was sexually harassed in the NAVY, preyed upon in my career as an Healthcare Administrator and not paid the same as a male peer even through I outperformed him.  When I brought the fact that I was harassed by several males in the military to the Naval lawyer she said, ""The military does not have the same standards as the civilian sector"".  A married man literally pulled me to him and grabbed my rear end.  I pulled away immediately and reported it to my male supervisor, but since the perpetrator was getting discharged that day, there was nothing I could do to press charges.  When I was working as a Healthcare Administrator I did not submit to my Area Manager's sexual advances - then coincidentally placed in an outlying facility an hour away from my home, when younger female Administrator with less education and experience got to work in my hometown.  I also received less pay for same work as a male in my industry. Now that women are in higher positions of power, we are seeing a shift in becoming aware these injustices against women, but need to keep getting our women educated, by staying in the workforce with child care help,  and given the same Executive privileges men get to even out the playing field."
129,"How many potential geniuses, inventions, storied careers has this country lost due to its *official* ""white men only"" structure for the vast majority of its history?

And yet the gender and racial discrimination and barriers continue.

What a waste."
130,"One thing I haven't heard mentioned often is what happens when women rise and find themselves supervising men.  I have had younger men be rude, swear nonstop in one-on-one meetings to wield power and show disrespect, assume they know more than me, and clearly resent being supervised by a middle aged woman.  Middle aged women are some of the most devalued and resented people in our culture. No longer ornamental nor utilitarian (past procreating age) what use are they? the logic seems to go. 

Hillary Clinton is exhibit ""A."" It wasn't a problem of superiors hitting on a younger woman.  It was a whole country of men not wanting someone like their mom or their hated grammar school teacher calling the shots.  So the most qualified presidentially candidate of all time was replaced by a profane, stupid, preening, manipulative, odious male."
131,"There's a reason why mothers always protected their daughters from men. They cannot be trusted. Men know that, too, about themselves, too. They happily admit they're dogs. But protective mothers are considered old-fashioned now. We send our daughters away to college where they live in unchaperoned co-ed dorms. Then after graduation they typically go to the big cities where they meet a whole new set of problems which they have to deal with on their own--psycho boyfriends, strangers on the street, and, as this op-ed piece points out, lecherous bosses who cannot keep their pants zipped up. In what world is this okay? We supposedly believe in equality of the sexes and have laws and legal protections accordingly. But mother was right. Equality is fine, but protect yourself first. "
132,"The despicable behavior toward people like Sallie Krawcheck may have been pervasive, but they were not universal.

I spent my career on Wall Street. We should expunge the pigs and not throw all men into a single category of behavior.

Judge the guilty harshly. Allow the rest of us to build a more positive future.

I desperately want that for my daughters. And my son."
133,"""This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women ? a view that?s costing all of us.""

So, to defeat the alleged wisdom of the market males strategically lower the performance bar encouraging a culture of consensus mediocrity and group serving me-too expectations?  If men weren't so afraid of each other something useful and effective might actually get done."
134,"Sallle, there is something unique about American sexism, tied to its Hyper capitalism, pure market economics and being a super power, that does not get addressed in any analysis on sexism, misogyny and patriarchy in the United States. A macho psychology of ruthless male competition, even within and between companies, defines American economic culture, and its social values. This has a direct impact on how women are treated, and how everything and most-things feminine are perceived and rejected. I wrote about this more than 25 years ago...after growing up and living abroad for many years. 

One of the shocking revelations from a bunch of young White men, some liberal, for why they did not vote for Hillary was: 1) She, being a woman, is not tough enough to stand up effectively against terrorists and other misogynistic men overseas...which may explain why Hillary sounded more hawkish than some Conservatives during the Primaries, and considered Kissinger to be her mentor, just to appeal to this group And 2) The opposite reason from some was that she appeared like an obnoxious witch or bi___, with nothing feminine that made them feel nurtured, protected and safe. 

Why these two opposite responses? Because American women, especially Anglo women, except for a tiny minority, have to constantly react to their Anglo male world and Anglo male power. Their identities and their perspectives are built around following or emulating men, or simply being the opposite. This never got resolved"
135,"Social Justice isn't going to come for women who work on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley the day before women who work at Walmart or Denny's. Class is here as ever the elephant in the room. It's the same for Black Americans, there are plenty of wealthy and upper middle class blacks now. Likewise gay people. The well being of wealthy gays is not the right objective to fight for. The Patriarchy will fall when legislation is drafted which protects all women and betters their lot regardless of their class. If ambitious female professionals try to carve off a special place for themselves in the Oligarchy, they won't swing many votes to their side, certainly not enough to pass the legislation neccessary to secure social justice for all.  "
136,"If the firms devalue women, what would be better than women starting their own firms. There is a global movement for women to become entrepreneurs. Those women entrepreneurs, who start from the ground up, can also become natural leaders in their communities and change men's opinions about women. It is time for new thinking on feminism. "
137,"Tell other women their talent and education is irrelevant on Wall Street.

If they stay, their achievements will be attributed to a man, regardless of his contribution.  You will never climb the ladder.  Your role is to support the men and keep them in control.

I often counseled young women to leave the firm.  Most didn't listen and wasted several years before leaving."
138,"Entrenched sexism in Wall Street and Silicon Valley are essentially about theft, a time-honored approach to fast profits. NYer's story is a classic or tragic illustration of a sanctioned free rider problem. It happens to men too, but women are often easier pickings and the risk of retribution down the road is less."
139,"I'm disturbed by the number of commenters praising this piece by saying that at last we're discussing what's really important, and then dismissing the recent reporting on sexual harassment as being trivial and irrelevant. People, the two are related. We are not going to get to a place where women's ideas and contributions are valued equally and women are given equal pay for equal work without addressing the way women are viewed and treated, in the workplace and beyond. Notice that this piece begins with accounts of the sexual harassment the author has faced?she clearly thinks there's a connection."
140,"Even in 2017 women for the most part are viewed as property, a potential sex partner, or a baby factory to give birth to more men. Its reflected in our politics, our religions, and our general cultural beliefs. We have conditioned women from the age of 6 and up to play second fiddle, be seen and not heard, and the only thing you are valued for is if you are beautiful. Even to this day a woman can't vote, drive, or own property certain parts of the world. Yet, even in the land of the free we still treat women like second class citizens when it comes to the boardroom. Women have made great strides in our society but the journey is far from over."
141,"Yep - all too familiar in my 20-year career. It routinely happens to every woman I know, every day. 

For all you recent female entrants to the workforce:  welcome to a world of disillusionment.  And I'm sorry to say it, but get used to being demeaned.  

I hope the millennial generation of women can force more change than we did.  

And for you millennial men - please be more conscious of your behavior than men of earlier generations."
142,"We thought discrimination against women happens
in Middle East. Kudos to Sallie Krawcheck for enduring
the harassment and moving up by performing well. Hope

will constrain men and alter the situation for women."
143,"I sat quietly in a conference room with a bunch of male Government employees while they talked about how NOAA came to have so many women in management. They did not seem to think it was such a bad idea. Seems the Department of Commerce had a requirement to hire and promote women some years back and NOAA was perceived as the least harmful place to dump these women. Polling in the DC area you find NOAA is always in the top 5% of favorite agencies to work at. NOAA is run on a shoestring budget and never do you see charges of any kind of harassment among it's ranks. Spending 25 years supporting the government in DC I have to say NOAA had the best holiday parties, Summer picnics and going away festivities. All potluck and paid for by employees."
144,"Great points in your article, but need to point out that men alone are not the only holders of bias.
In Israel, where I live, many religious women scathe men who encourage them to participate in the workforce or in the military. According to them, a women's responsible is to have and raise children, while working and military service are exclusively for men.
If only women in Israel would take up men's plea for them to join in the workforce!!"

148,"I was part of the men's movement of the 1970s. We were explicitly anti-sexist. Yes, we focused on our own personal development as mature individuals, but we also focused on fixing our attitudes towards women, valuing them as we valued ourselves, seeking full equality with them in all manner of ways.

Then came the drummers and wild men. Out went equality, in came strutting and shouting and anti-alimony lawyers. 

Then things turned again. It seemed like men were getting the message that equality with women was good for everyone. 

Now we find that men, let's hope they're in a minority, men really haven't gotten the message. And now the consequences are enormously disastrous. The federal courts, the environmnent, government regulation, the nation's global reputation and commitments, all shattered. By sexist bigots as much as by anyone."
149," Intellectual misogyny continues long after retirement. Men who may have always controlled their sexual desires to dominate in the workplace never  Felt the need to equally manage their need to mentally dominate. Therefore they interrupt women constantly or they ignore something a woman says and shortly thereafter applaud a similar comment or proposal made by a man (without attribution or reference to what the woman said).  Or they plagiarize written words of women. I am amazed even in retirement even in supposedly collegial discussion groups, this behavior continues. "
150,"I sell rare coins for a living. Women comprise a few percent of the clientele, and perhaps a tenth as much of the dollar volume.

I also play chess, where the percentages of female participation are similar.

I don't see that women are discriminated against in these fields. Their money and their moves are genderless and have the same value as men's. Women's self-perceptions limit them in activities like games and collecting, which are competitive.

So are elections, and in 2016 a woman lost to the competition. The fact that she won the VOTE only makes it worse; she didn't know how to play the game to win.

The changes Ms Krawcheck would like to see --me too!!-- are hindered by both Men's and Women's perceptions of women. Hillary's defeat was a teachable moment squandered. 

And who is most to blame? WHITE WOMEN who voted for the quintessential embodiment of the problem."
151,"The actions of O?Reilly, Ailes & Moore speak for themselves. But so many of these men who held themselves out as progress Democrats turned out to be the worst violators of women.

152,"I support this law, though I believe Tony Longo is also correct: its most immediate impact would be to help lawyers, not citizens.  <br/><br/>The next necessary step would be for a group of volunteers to create simple but accurate charts that show the every day person what the algorithm is doing and how to apply it to real-world situations.  The NYTimes has created graphs like these in the past; perhaps they could jump-start this effort in the course of a report on the newly-revealed code.  Over the long term, true transparency would require constant updates to the explanations/interpretations, and that would require a dedicated cadre of volunteers. "
153,"The algorithms are not simply code. They are chains of equations (sometimes only a single equation) that purportedly model reality but often are based on either unrealistic assumptions or outright bias to get a desired allocation of services and resources.<br/><br/>The NYC-Rand Institute made up algorithms for fire service allocation in the late 1960's-1970's that guaranteed cuts in fire control service to poor neighborhoods of color and other areas with low status populations. Because the NYFD could wave these equations around at community meetings, many neighborhoods were silenced in the face of ""science"". The equations also served in court cases to ""prove"" that the cuts were not capricious or discriminatory. But the models were rife with unrealistic assumptions and data-poverty. Indeed, Rand reports openly stated the notion that the data would be too laborious, voluminous, and complex to analyze.<br/><br/>We need transparency on these algorithms and on all bases of service and resource allocation. There is little justice or mercy in how fire service was or is allocated. Other services that have at times been wretchedly allocated were Sanitation in the Dinkins Administration and Police in nearly all administrations since Wagner."
154,"This is deeply naïve. The City makes huge amounts of technical information available on a regular basis, e.g. in the semi-annual Budget and Mayor's Management Report, and virtually no one ever looks. This continually demonstrates that no one cares about the allocation of City resources and the results of agency operations, only political infighting.<br/>Only other coders would be able to read code, and their only motive to read the code in the programs you refer to would be in the service of lawyers attempting to prove bias, etc. The history of litigation over issues like these - such as the technicalities of eligibility determination in social services - completely demonstrates that experts on opposite sides will conclude exactly what their opposing lawyers are paying them to find. ""Bias"" is not a characteristic of computer code; it's a characteristic of human judgment.<br/>You can't judge fairness by examining things at the sausage-maker level, only by looking at the results."
155,"Marwick: ""Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed.""

Facebook already gives users some control over sorting. The problem is that the setting to sort by most recent is temporary:

https://www.facebook.com/help/218728138156311

Marwick: ""This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, ...""

Before proposing ways to ""increase the diversity of items in the News Feed"", Marwick should define ""diversity"" and explain how it can be measured.

Marwick: ""... and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn?t support their own confirmation bias.""

Why would users want that? Marwick seems to be taking the authoritarian position that she knows what is best for users.

We are in America.  Businesses have rights too.  We are all so anxious to take away other's rights claiming it is transparency for us.  The problem with platforms like facebook is that they are robbing us of our own privacy and rights.

171,"Facebook has become a conduit for low quality content (alien mysteries stories, crazy cures, fake news, etc.) not because it does not censor, but because it is pressured by the current business model shared by all social media to rely on specific economic incentives for such content. The most pressing question is how to fix the monetization model of social media.  The current fake news crisis is the direct product of the pay per click monetization model, which creates huge incentives for content producers to ignore everything else, including the veracity of the message, for maximizing click-through. If in the golden era of television the shibboleth was ""if it bleeds, it leads"" now the slogan is ""if it clicks, it pays."" Fake news is, in my view, a mere extension of the trend for tabloidization, which has turned from a marginal phenomenon a pandemic after and because of pay per click business models. Moreover, ""content marketing"" programs, like taboola on the web and sponsored stories on Facebook, made fake news even more feasible, since they keep telling us that the only way to get clicks is to tell attractive, intriguing, ""tell me more"" stories. This is precisely what fake news does. Something simple, such as switching from pay per click to CPM, which increases the cost of advertising might go a long way toward reducing junk content and pseudo-advertising."
172,"How is getting an ad from Mercedes Benz via Facebook on steps to resolve climate change different from getting one from a Russian firm about another divisive issue?  As I understand the Russian process, the ads were simply bait to identify possible targets.  No ads mentioned candidates or parties.  The classic political ads against Democrats occurred via standard web pages delivered to receptive people identified on Facebook.  

The real solution is to stop paying attention.  I systematically throughout the campaign removed access to every third party share tossed my way by friends.  It was amazing how quickly my feed was empty of typical political tripe after only 30 deletions.  Others can do likewise."

It's hard to believe that Zuckerberg would be willing to give up the power he has accumulated, but if his declaration (with his wife) to donate 99% of his wealth to charity is sincere, he would follow Tim Wu's suggestion.
If you conceive of the Internet as an operating system (which I do), it was born missing many of the standard facilities of conventional ones: namely, user accounts, storage (and indexed searching), security, etc.  As inevitable as the laws of physics, the Internet Operating System inevitably demanded that somebody had to provide those facilities.  Because of a particular moment in time (drop in cost of bandwidth and storage, open source server technology, and availability of inexpensive point-and-shoot digital photography) and Zuckerberg and the Winkelvoss Twins insights into young people willingness to trade their still forming identities for sexual opportunities, Facebook arose.
It is that essential Internet Operating System user account facility. Unfortunately, it's panoptic access to informaton about everyone's interactions with content and with each other, has permitted to build persuasive systems that are inherently at odds with its professed mission."
180,"I have a large scar running diagonally from my clavicle to my breast. It is the result of a grain-of-rice-sized malignant melanoma that developed when I was 20. The disfigurement was mortifying throughout my twenties. I bought a whole new wardrobe in order to cover it (difficult to do in an era where low-cut clothing is the expectation for young women who don't want to be taken as puritanical). I don't like when people ask about it, and as long as I am showing it, someone always does. At 29, I guess you could say that I still wish the scar weren't there-- I don't go out of my way to show it off, but, as I get older it gets easier to see. Articles like this and the comments in them help me feel much less alone and inspire me to reframe how I view this unique part of me."
181,"I have plenty of large and small scars, from various surgeries, but these days, they don?t even phase me. The one I worry about most is that of my 6.5 year old daughter. She has a scar that runs horizontally across the entire width of her belly. She earned it at seven days old, when she had to have her first surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis. Her infancy was a rough one, but after three months in the NICU, she was able to come home. It bothered me to look at her scar, when it was so angry and red. Eventually, it faded and mellowed, and I made a promise to myself that I would do my very best to keep her from hating that scar. After all, that scar came from a surgery that saved her life. As she learned to point to her nose, eyes, and ears, I also taught her to point to her scar, as if it were just any other body part. Now, as much as I hate bikinis on small children, if she were to ask me to get her one, I would. I want her to grow up believing that her scar does not make her any less beautiful than her peers. I want her to know that scars tell the story of an interesting life. I want her to tell the story of how she SURVIVED."
182,"A breast cancer survivor, divorced in my mid forties, I was reluctant to enter the dating scene as well.

Some show, some not so much."".  Still grateful for his understanding."
183," II still do wish my face was 'normal'.
I have had a facial scar since age 6 for the removal of a dermatofibro  sarcoma protuberans (DFSP). From 6-13, it was noticeable, but acceptable to me as it was a straight line on my left cheek. I then had a graft from my right thigh. When the tumor reoccurred at age 13, I underwent a radical excision and fat graft. I also lost the ability to smile on my left side. I didn't think about it much until 13 when my face changed drastically.  I was reserved in high school and worried about my appearance when dating. A few men, on a first date are dismissive. I have a thick skin.  have had a number of relationships and it was never an issue to my partners or my husbands. I haven't had any difficulty obtaining and retaining good jobs. II still do wish my face was 'normal'."

I have two more scars that run perpendicular to my long body scar, at the base of my rib cage. These are my life-saving scars. I have a scar on the crook of my right elbow. Lots of small scars that evidence  scapes and crashes through the wild lands of youth, and the burn scars on the forearms from a few years of laboring in a professional kitchen. Each in their sequence are stories of my life. So I?m ok with them.... now that I don?t have to prove my worth with a beautiful body of youth. "
186,"I have a scar on my right underarm and a small portion of that breast. I've had it for more than 50 years. It's as much a part of me as, say, my fingers. It shows when I wear bathing suits and certain sleeveless tops. I remember a friend saying (almost shrieking), ""Eww, gross!"" when I was about 11. But even then, I thought she was the one who had a problem, not me. I like my scar. It reminds me when I got it -- in my then-city's children's hospital, where I met wonderful kids who had been in and out of hospitals their entire lives (sometimes ""in"" for months at a time), with multiple operations and missed schooling. They were resilient and very kind to me, a ""hospital newbie,"" and I realized how fortunate I was. "

189,"In 1977 I had radical neck surgery on the right side of my neck to remove all the lymph glands below along with a salivary gland after earlier removal of a dime-sized malignant melanoma. Surgery required removal of about a five inch circumference of tissue one inch deep. Note I said ?removal?. The ?divot? was covered with a similar sized skin graft from my hip. Fresh skin grafts are an odd shade of pink while your body decides if it?s ok with the transfer of tissue, surrounded by a dark red outline. After a few years it turned white and has never ?matched? the surrounding skin.  I was 24 years old, single, and not seriously dating at the time. Small children, to the general embarrassment of their parents, would routinely call attention to my scar, which I couldn?t easily cover up or camouflage. 

I got used to my scar quickly because I had no choice. When I married 3 years later, I wore a low cut dress. Who knows, if I?d been able to hide it easier I might feel the same as the writer. After 40 years I?m still alive after melanoma, something two of my friends form childhood didn?t manage, so I?m ok with it.

My advice? Accept the new you, rejoice in your survival, and to hell with those who can?t or won?t accept you as you are. "
190,"I too have had a similar scar from a lymph node dissection relating to cancer 42 years ago. And I salute all the commentators here for their proud outlook on survival (of that disease, and other causes). But I do want to sound a cautionary note.
Recently I have had two episodes of SBO -  small bowel obstruction. The intestines at a point get twisted, choking off any movement within, up or down the digestive system. The belly swells and the pain is excruciating. Both episodes resulted in hospital stays for draining the stomach.
I was told by the attending physicians that the cause of blockage is scar tissue within the body. And, so far I have been told, that nothing can be done to prevent future occurrences.
What was my visible symbol of conquering the C disease has come back to torment me.  But I'm still looking for other medical opinions, and I'm still fighting. Nothing is easy in this world.
I truly wish that this does not happen to anyone else."
191,"I'm 66. On October 14, 2014, I had a liver transplant after I was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV) owing to infection with Hepatitis C, acquired many, many years before. The resulting scar is about 9 inches long and dominates my entire torso from my sternum down the left and right sides of my abdomen. The doctors like to refer to it as an inverted Mercedes medallion. (It cost much more than any Mercedes!) I like to think of it as an inverted Peace Symbol. And to a certain degree, I have come to terms and peace with ""my scar."" 

To be sure, every scar, physical or psychological,  carried by every person is as individual as the life that person. Since then, I have struggled daily with the physical evidence of this most traumatic time of my life, but more importantly, with the psychological scar that it has left. It's a constant reminder of just how fragile our bodies are and how tenuous life can be. It also reminds me, on a daily basis, of how lucky I have been and how unfortunate so many others are. It reminds me, on a daily basis, of the man who gave his life so that I might live, and how ""small"" acts of charity can have a profound impact on so many lives. It reminds me daily of how vanity can really hinder us and that beauty is truly only skin deep. And it reminds everyday that even in our loneliest and darkest hours of suffering and weakness, there is a resilience that can be found in all of us, and that life is worth the struggle. Happy Holidays to all!"
192,"Good article...I have had a scar on my left upper arm since being burned as a infant. For years I was embarrassed to go shirtless, but, later on, as I achieved a modicum of success as a teenage athlete, it became essentially a non-issue. It actually provided somewhat of a litmus test by which to evaluate the character of a woman that I was interested in. My wife of 40 years has never even commented on it, and the fact that she has accepted me totally, scars and all, visible and non-visible, is a major reason that I have loved her for all these years...A minor correction: Dr. Jeffrey Marcus is the current chief of plastic surgery at Duke."
193,"My mother died of breast cancer when I was 12 and all the doctors ever said was that it would be my fate. 

When I was a young woman working out at the YMCA in Chicago, there was an older woman in the locker room who had had a mastectomy. She was lean and scarred and quite frankly, it was inspiring to see this active, older woman, scarred by cancer, living her life. 

Scars are nothing what we desire for our body. I will always appreciate the scarred woman who was not ashamed of her mastectomy and who showed me that life - a physically active life - happens after cancer. 

Best of luck to you. "
194,"I?ve had nine abdominal surgeries over the past 30 years. For a while, I had an ostomy bag, as well, until one of my surgeries reversed that. Scars are evidence of how your life was saved when the end was close enough to see and feel. There is absolutely nothing embarrassing about them. Actually, they are a sign of our strength and resilience. They are no less a part of my body than my hand, my leg or my head. "
195,"It's hard. I try to love all my scars because each one represents something I triumphed over.
One of them is on the side of my face, and I have become so accustomed to it that I do feel a little alarmed and affronted when someone blurts out something about it.
It's fun to think that if this happens again-- and not only for the scar on my face-- I will look that person in the eye and say with a jaunty smile, ""Dueling scar. You shoulda seen the other guy.""
How they respond will probably set a path for any shared future we might have. "

197,"At the age of seventeen, I was in a serious car accident. As a trauma patient, I was cut from my sternum to four inches below my navel, not to mention the additional scars from a chest tube and drainage tubes. I suffered numerous broken ribs and a broken clavicle, leaving me slightly deformed, with my left shoulder sitting slightly higher than my right. I thought for certain no one would ever want me, as my only self worth was tied to my appearance. I look at my scars as a blessing. Not only would I not be here today if not for the surgery that saved my life, but as a result, my career choices were dictated by my mental abilities, not my physical appearance. My scars taught me at an early age not to rely so heavily on appearance. My scars may very well have saved me from being another Ms. Tweeden. I found that only shallow people can?t see past scars. I?ve been married twice and had wonderful boyfriends in between. Still going strong after seventeen years in marriage #2. Sometimes scars save us in more ways than we realize."
198,"My answer would be, ?What scar??"
199,"I had a C-section, hysterectomy, and last Easter, hernia surgery--they kept unzipping the same vertical scar, which is now 9 inches long. Scar tissue can be rubbery and tough--even inside--and can glom other structures together (why I got the hernia, they said), I guess I would rather not have all this, even though I am past the age of showing it off, but I am not giving back the baby (now 35) or getting back the agonizing fibroids or death-dealing hernia, so ...onward I go."
200,"I burned myself with hot water at the age of 17 months back in the late 1960's by crawling into our bathroom sink and, perhaps, trying to give myself a bath. I've lived my whole life with a 3rd degree burn scar on most of my leg and on my side. In a society that fetishizes women's legs, it hasnt always been easy. But, with the confidence that comes from having supportive parents, I joined a swim team as a kid and never stopped, swimming on scholarship through college, and I still train with a team at the ago of 50. Can't get more scar exposure than in a swim suit! While I was always self-conscious of my scar, when I'm in my swim suit and on a racing block, any self-consciousness disappears instantly. And my teammates have never looked twice at my leg; they see a fast swimmer, not a burned leg.  "
201,"After my divorce, my dating life was rocky. Observing all this, my (quirky) Chinese lab mate asked me one day if it was fair of me to keep dating, and could I really love someone new when I had ?so many scars on my heart.?

I told him it doesn?t work that way. Yes- a heart with multiple ?breaks? was different than one without, but it still beats and is capable of love. Scar tissue is a tough barrier our body carefully created to reinforce a vulnerable opening. We need it to keep us alive, but it doesn?t have to restrict our future. We are more than the sum of our parts. 

You can?t see my scars, but I have them. Making them made me understand how beautiful it is to be alive and how thankful I am (despite the dangers) to be able to give and receive love.

I hope yours do the same for you. "

Facebook allows a senator Mark Warner to bully them info cooking up some dubious ""evidence"" he can use to pretend the lies he has been pushing the last year to cover up something that must smell  very bad by now.

Twitter gets asked in congress why someone who clearly must be censored has a viral hashtag just then. And the Twitter representant display his obedience and promise it will immediately be taken care of. 

Twitter even bragged how the were suppressing damning information from going viral like the Wikileaks emails exposing the corruption, rigging of primary, fraud and lies by one of the candidates during last years election.

Media keep pumping out fake news trying to take down the candidate that beat the candidate they full on supported and gaslighted for during the election. The depth of that collusion was exposed in leaked emails where one could see how the campaign was basically given editorial power on stories. They where also given to influence coverage and reporting about the opponent.

Lately they have turned so desperate they push out a fake news story. Then only after it's long past gone viral they quietly retract and call in a mistake. Of course they have never mistakenly published a positive fake news story.

It's a battle for minds & control of reality"
207,"""Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election."" LOL. The easiest way to prevent this is to not place ads in the middle of people's feeds, which is how it was years ago. Put ads on the side, where people ignore them or, at least, have come to understand that they are ads because of their periphery placement. This statement from FB just demonstrates how insincere they are about committing to social responsibility. The same can be said about all the other tech giants. "
208,"There is a lot in common between the tech industry and the gun industry.  Gun makers like to claim ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people.""  Of course this ignores the fact that guns allow people to kill far more effectively, and efficiently.  In the same manner, apparently neutral tech platforms allow racists, sexists, climate change deniers, etc to amplify their voice far beyond what the old fashioned telephone or newsletter ever allowed.  China solves this problem with government censorship.  It will be interesting to see how we cope with it in a society where free speech is enshrined in the constitution."
209,"I didn't know the tech industry was going through a self introspection, thanks for this article. There are so many awesome things that high tech has enabled, but it has also:
- Isolated the elderly for whom every new experience requires a bewildering amount of gadget knowledge.
- Enables your neighbors to find out very personal details of your life at the click of a button (marriages, bankruptcies, etc.)
- Enables hiring managers to automatically reject you based on age even before a person steps foot in the office.
- Easy availability of porn skews our culture. Period.
The above list is random and not life and death, but how a society functions with compassion and kindness is dependent on things at the smaller scale. You can truly understand this if you have kids and have actually experienced their transformation as well as the transformation of your family dynamic once they're exposed to the cellphone and social media. It?s not enough that you don?t raise your kids that way. Steve Job?s children may have been raised ?right? but they don?t live in an island. Those kids will still become part of the greater world which did not grow up with their values.

The saying ?Don?t do it just because you can? really applies to tech. The industry needs to self regulate and we also need laws to keep up, but we cannot rely on the lawmakers to initiate this as they often do not understand technology and its ramifications. We need the tech industry to be true leaders of society."

These companies have spent a tremendous amount of money in 2017 on PR, lobbying, and crisis management consultants. They all operate in an environment where they have to maximize short term gains to their shareholders (despite what Zuckerberg said). Their action really amount to very little responsibility.

""Timothy D. Cook, Apple?s chief executive, told my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin that Apple had a ?moral responsibility? to attempt to heal the nation?s social and economic fissures"". Is hiding billions of dollars in Jersey considered moral responsibility or greed? It seems that the term ""moral responsibility"" used by tech leaders is equivalent to the use ""fake news"" by our president.

I invite you to go further, though, in at least a couple of ways during your college years and after.
Take the ""can still be salvaged"" theme, which is not that well developed in the many fields either now which have come to resemble K-12 education in their reliance on ""accountability"" (although they sometimes call it something else). Consider more just how to fix some of these issues, keeping the best of what they can provide, while connecting them to complementary approaches such as you briefly mention.
Also, ponder just how did we get this so wrong? Why were we so certain and how did we miss things--until, of course, we didn't--in case after case, field after field. For instance, just looking at football, measures of success were universally accepted and appeared to be so simple. There was nothing, apparently, to even talk about; there was the score at the end of the game and the final rankings. But then we had Hall of Famers dying young because of undiagnosed brain injuries and Penn State not doing anything about child abuse.
Use this as a giant metaphor for misplaced certainty and not knowing what we don't know--above and beyond testing, for looking at a lot of the issues we're struggling with. Hopefully, your generation can do better at this.

233,"And to think conservatives coined the phrase ""snowflake"" to describe liberals. They should look in the mirror!"
234,"As I read the title of this article I thought about how childish and pathetic this administration is.

Trump uses Twitter and other social media to spread his lies, attack his critics, defend his cruel, petty and vindictive policies, demean President Barack Obama when ever he can, undermine U.S. allies, encourage hatred towards the media, vilify Hillary Clinton constantly, tweet erroneous stories that he heard on  Fake Fox & Friends, and Re-tweets posts from neo-Nazis...There's much more. Need I go on?

And now he whines that no one has any 'good' things to say about him. Oh Please."

240,"Google is the leader in the search engines market because its algorithms are better than the other competitors'. Before Google we had AOL and Yahoo, but when we the people found that Google produced more exact matches, and in higher quantities, faster, we decided to crown it as the King.

We don' t think that Google is going to alter the algorithms to please any politician. Because making changes will undoubtedly alter the accuracy of the whole system. A potential mathematical disaster. In very simple terms if they decide that 2  2 = 5, from where did they get the additional 1? Oh, they should create another formula that says 3  3 = 5. And so on.

Search engines in countries with dictatorships are altered by the censors. They hate accuracy. For example in April 10 2018, the censors deleted all the information related to the Goldman Sachs Group and Venezuela. Thanks to algorithms the information resurfaced three days later.

A graphic way to show how algorithms work is the Rubik Cube. You have to use the proper movements to finish the job faster. If you, in desperation use a knife, or worst, a hammer. You destroy the magic. https://youtu.be/NevGDFBfQGw"

242,"This is the same misinformation strategy that creating the joke of 'fair and balanced reporting' during the 2016 campaign, where the repubs make outlandish and false statements on a daily basis and the press bowed and took notes like a freshman in a class by Albert Einstein. Let's not do this again.
A lie is a lie and should not be afforded the same coverage as fact.

243,"The executive branch enforces laws.  Even if Google et al are biased there couldn't possibly be a law  Because Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  So Trump can shove off."
244,"Part of the problem is that the press approaches Trump as if he were a credible source/politician/president. Thus, we end up with articles and essays like this one, and everyone seems surprised, or outraged, or what have you. All you needed to do was end the headline after the second word: Trump Whines. That would free you up to cover important topics that sometimes get sidelined by the antics of this ridiculous person/president."
245,"If one uses Infowars as the apex of the bell curve upon which this line of reasoning stands, then, of course, the rest of the data will be skewed to the left of center. It is the warped prism from which DJT views the world. He has used Twitter extensively, and yet criticizes it for not being fair. He wants to hear from people that agree with him. He is a broken, hypocritical, unethical, unhinged xenophobe. He wants the western world to remain under white peopled hegemony and can't stand the idea of a browning western world.

The universe of social media consists mostly of younger, well-informed, well educated GenXers, millennials and etc.  These young adults want a fairer, more inquisitive, more inclusive, cleaner world. They reject the thinking of DJT and his ilk. But they are the future and we owe them a better America than Trump can provide.

The task of the media is to keep writing, keep exposing, keep its bias to a minimum, and tell ALL of the truth. "

Any discussion with a pro tromp person travels to the toilet with the response that ?you were just saying that because of a liberal bias.?"
248,"Didn't Facebook give the Russians a big boost as they interfered in our elections in order to help the Trump campaign? Didn't Google's YouTube implicitly endorse RT--the Kremlin's own propaganda media organ? Didn't Twitter just change its rules so that now the president's account is in a Twitter category of his own--which they will never block no matter how much he violates the rules that apply to the rest of us vis-à-vis bullying, violence, racism, and the like? Didn't--and don't they still?--these three monopolies function as behavior modification machines for the Trump GOP or any other bad actor who sought to manipulate their users via rage, resentment and hatred? 

My goodness. If that isn't MAGA-friendly, what is?"
249,"In my opinion we (rational Americans) should try to ignore the majority of what President Trump tweets or says. If anything, he's building a solid case for Impeachment. In the meantime, he's irritating the heck out of the majority of Americans, most of whom will be fed up and ready to vote at midterm against any politicians aligning themselves with Trump and his ideology."

As for Google, you can see what giving in to authoritarians does. It weakens us all as individuals, excludes our ability to grow from an honest interchange of ideas. 

As for Twitter, it should block Trump for bullying. Give those who demand equal time for evil no quarter. 

After all, it is still true that for evil to triumph, good people merely need to do nothing. "
252,I'd love to see Google and other media companies sue the Trump government for its unrelenting attack on media companies' first amendment rights. This government has gone too far.  
253,"One reason Trump may not get the results he likes is that his favorite news organization (using that term loosely) daily creates a different reality than most other sites.  For example, on the day that Manafort was found guilty of 8 felonies and Cohen pled guilty, Fox's lead headline was about the immigration status of the alleged murderer of the young woman in Iowa.   The Manafort and Cohen news, reported front-and-center nearly everywhere else, was all-but-buried at Fox.  Maybe, if he wants to read only favorable coverage of himself, Trump should go straight to Fox."
254,"I think 2 major points are not emphasized here:

- Right wing extremists and Trump have been waging a war on truth, and this is part of it. He's basically encouraging people not to use regular search and social media outlets (or don't trust the news reported there), and instead get their news directly from some right wing site.

- Criticism like this will further encourage the likes of Facebook and Google to strengthen the algorithms that show each person the articles he/she would prefer based on their political preferences. This way when Trump does a web search, he'd only see articles praising him! With this going on, after a while if two people with different political leanings switch their phones, they'd feel like they've been dropped on a different planet."
255,Isn't the basic tenet of conservative political practice to avoid regulations on businesses?
256,"Didn't Trump, as a candidate, ridicule women, make hostile remarks about NFL players who didn't stand for the anthem at football games, lead chants about Hilary Clinton, and say that he might not accept the results of the 2016 presidential election if he lost?  As I recall, when I typed in certain things during his presidential campaign I didn't see more ""liberal"" sites or listings.  I saw quite a few extreme right sites.  

He's using this to avoid the real problems he may be facing.  His loyal toadies are turning on him and getting deals for themselves.  The louder he yells the more we ought to look at what's happening with the investigation Mueller is running.  "
257,"It is terrible that there are teens, girls, students, being mistreated in such a repulsive way. I feel like many actions should be taking place to resolve this serious issue. What we can do stuff like teaching kids at an early age to keep a certain space to those who aren't close family members and friends, and also teach them on what to do in certain situations like self-defense to prevent mistreatment in a sexual way."
258,"If fashion is art can be debated on forever. Personally to me, fashion is not art. You wear things to cover you private body. If you wear something with complex designs then its cool but it does not make it art. Adding too, if someone has a more coordinated look then you people say it's more fashion forward. However it just means they can match and they are not an artist. I also do not consider people who make clothes artists. Your literally just making clothes for people to cover themselves with. Now you could say well they are making complex designs but in the end they will still just wear it. Also, in the video they showed how art is filled with people with clothing. This is an indicator of history for what people wear but the fashion is not the art. You can only draw so many naked people and a lot of artists don't like to do that at all. People with clothing have to be drawn. So no fashion is not art, its a way people dress to cover themselves."
259,People need to remind these children throughout their life through adulthood need to learn about personal space and what's right and wrong to do and to always ask for consent no matter what.
260,it's very sad us high schools girls have to deal with such nasty things this young at age
261,"Honesty I´m surprised that in middle school students can experience sexual harassment from their peers. That´s awful and just scares parents to even know that , that statistic exists. Reading some stories make it seem like some teachers and adults do not take it serious. This should not be a thing anyone boy or girl should have to deal with. "
262,As someone who grew up both in the USA and in Europe this country is just an aweful place for kids. From the freak underlying Puritanism that drives so many things to the creepy men and women it?s just a terrible place for kids. I believe coming to the USA just stunted my sexual development and ability to connect like I see in my European cousins and it is something I can never get back. This society will just devolve into some freakish combination of binge drinking tinder hook ups and #metoo episodes of people molesting each other and Puritan paranoia over catching some std and unwed teenage pregnancies.  This stuff just honestly doesn?t really happen in Europe at this sort of level.  Americans really need to examine themselves and their issues with sexuality that is driving this awful culture.
263,"Twenty years ago I was an aide in a 1st grade classroom. A sleepover was held. One little boy came up to a girl near me and told her he was going to climb into her sleeping bag and f%$# her after the lights went out.

I sent him back to his side of the room and informed the teacher that he should be sent home at once. She just laughed and told me he ""liked"" the girl. The teacher was a bully who made sure I could never take action myself, so I didn't... and I've always regretted it."
264,"A group of girls at our HS spoke to the faculty about the ubiquity of harassment since grade school.  Simply put, boys need to be shown, repeatedly and from an early age, how to respect  their fellow students.  And girls need to be taught how to make this the expectation.  So when both are young adults,  neither need live in fear of the other, hookup culture can become an anachronism, and we can finally progress as a society, instead of the regression we are currently in."
265,"How disappointing that this article minimizes the fact that 1) sexual abuse as a crime against minors, whether perpetrated by other minors or adults, is inherently more serious and criminal in nature than sexual harassment of adults by adults and 2) boys are (often) victims too, not just perpetrators. "
266,"Frankly I intend to teach my daughter that she has every right to protect herself even from ?just? a bra snap or whatever. That is violence and can be returned in kind if necessary by a loud scream, a push away or a slap.  Everyone should teach their daughters to not accept bad behavior and their sons not to engage in it. It is not the girls? job to just put up with it.  And obviously vice versa of course. "
267,"This is an essential component of the Me Too Movement. My freshman daughter & her friends all were in the Women's March with me & carried signs that said, ""Me Too, & I am Only 14"". On their signs they listed all the names they've been called, words which I don't think I can even say here. They posted pics of themselves with their signs on social media & were so horribly harassed for being in the march that the girls went to an Assistant Principal to ask for help. She recommended they ""start a club."" Schools are finally figuring out how to address bullying, but this is a whole different issue, & they have no idea how to handle it. I can talk about it in my home, but if it's not reinforced in school, then the MeToo Movement will simply be a fad that fades away."
268,"Turning both sexes against each other by bringing the #metoo movement to schools is just downright irresponsible, rotten behavior. "
269,"Great - just what America needs - to teach girls that all men are useless violent predators, who because of their limited humanity, cannot appreciate their natural inferiority to women. 

Yep - more Snowflakes - that?s what America needs. "
270,"The thing I keep noticing about this conversation is that I see a good deal of specificity about what we need to say or do regarding girls and women, and what we need to learn and do as girls and women; I see slightly less (with rather less specificity) with regard to what institutions -- schools, workplaces, etc. -- should do about harassment; but when it comes to boys and men...  I would be curious to see an article about what actions men are taking to alleviate this problem.  If it is possible to find enough to write about."
271,"My daughter was propositioned at age 6 by a classmate in the first grade. ?I want to take you behind the bushes [off the playground] and have sex.? This boy continued to harass my daughter for the next 5 years. The school never communicated with me after I reported the incident, and subsequent incidents of harassment. It was a learning opportunity for me and my daughter. She learned that I will advocate for her, support her efforts to keep him away from her, that what he was doing was dead wrong, that others in his life were not doing the right thing-exposing him to whatever experiences led a 6 year old to proposition a classmate for sex, and imposing seemingly no consequences for his behavior. She knows she doesn?t have to keep quiet or feel shame or responsibility. 

This was in a wealthy privileged community. And it started in first grade. It is not too soon for schools to wake up to teaching boys and girls where the boundaries are. This boy learned he can say or do anything to girls without consequence.  Just find the right victim who doesn?t have the support and skills my daughter has."
272,"I wish this article had mentioned violent degrading porn culture and easy access to it on social media by young boys. It affects how they view girls and women and can lead to disrespect, sexual harassment and violence."
273,"Political correctness gone awry.......

Besides, this movement is already on life support. Just look at the number of comments......let it die."
274,"No mention of how online porn viewing, which often starts at ages 11-13, has exacerbated this culture. "
275,"I?d also add that we adults should talk to young girls / teenagers about the sexual harassment they experience from ADULT men. I remember this starting around age 12 for me, and it being extremely confusing and, of course, unpleasant and scary. For some of my friends who developed early, this began for them even younger. I think it peaks at age 13, ugh! One day you?re an innocent child (for us lucky ones), and the next you?re fending off creepy men every time you walk down the street or otherwise go out in public. Our parents never discussed it with us. We never brought it up. I always assumed mine had no idea how lots of men treat little girls. Looking back, I?m sure my dad didn?t have any idea ; my mother, I?m positive, knew all too well. "
276,"Middle School Children are recipients of all kinds of treatment, much of it okay, so they do not know what to do when it is NOT okay. This also happens at younger ages.

Safe places for discussion and questioning of what's not okay is such an important resource. The barrage of sexualized implications and interactions when a child hits early prepuberty is unbelievable, for girls and boys, in peer groups, in media, sometimes in extended family events. The rise of smartphone use in younger age groups serves to magnify this pressure to accept that which is unacceptable.

Developmental stages blur and overlap, kids can look older but be quite young. All children deserve to live their childhoods without early onset sexual interactions, harassment and/or assault."
277,"Can we talk about bra-snapping, please?  It is one of the most ubiquitous sexual harassment actions in schools.  And it is painful!  It leaves red marks.  I remember spending days with anxiety, watching my back, because I hated the pinching, sharp pain.  It also says to everyone, Look, she's wearing a bra!

This is not fun, and it's not funny.  I don't understand why boys think that hurting and shaming girls is hilarious.  "
278,"No disrespect to Mx, but teaching kids not to hug their elders is bad juju. Our 2 kids are right brats mostly, but they hug their elders and kindly engage any older folks who say hello.   They hold doors and say thanks. And they mean it."
279,"Yes to talking much earlier to young people about what it means to say no and set up boundaries. But also I believe we need to talk to teen girls and young women about the word ""yes,"" and that's it normal and healthy to know what you like and want for yourself. There is such a fixation on the word NO that we are forgetting young women should also get to think about what feels good and right without fear of being labeled ""slutty"" or aggressive. Here's a link to a post about how to talk to teen girls about this that I really appreciated (full disclosure: I didn't write it but I'm the Exec Director of MEDIAGIRLS): http://www.mediagirls.org/blog/mediamondaytip-how-to-have-the-talk-with-....

280,"As a Lexington resident, I really do wish these students might have impressed on them a simple point: merely because they are able to live in Lexington, they are automatically among the most privileged human beings in all of history -- white of not, male or female. They are not being oppressed. They are, if anything, one and all, on the other side of the equation. 

How entitled must you be to imagine that, coming from such a background, you are nonetheless among the oppressed?

There really is a revolting level of self absorption and self aggrandizement in such a bizarre complaint. "

282,"The only way to bring-in  better standards of  inter-gender interface in the work place is to BEGIN with  an  agreed-upon list of 'banned terms'... and that with some penalty for the default. 
Since the women-factor has been virtually considered on par with the other two 'natural resources' - the land and the gold.. the abuse of that--has also been as common and as  the universal abuse of gold and land.  
Stipulation of  decent and human reference and address terms towards women as 'madam ' as corresponding to 'mr' should be prescribed as a NECESSARY term of reference and interaction.  This certainly will ease out the current anxious and ugly state of affairs to quite an extent.

283,"This article is about several important things, the #MeToo movement, the push for more inclusion (which is a related but separate issue) and the threat the studios posed by streaming services. But it presents itself as a story of malaise and anxiety at the studios, which it describes in vague terms and with a handful af anecdotes about a couple of studio execs acting antsy over drinks. Don't really think there is anything new to learn from this."
284,"Diversity, inclusion, Me Too pc blather mean nothing, nor should they. The film business needs to jettison quota based bizarre radical left social constructs unrelated to the core business of making quality movies with the best talent. Any sort of inclusion, diversity should be completely incidental to the final outcome. Merit is the only legitimate criteria. Outcome based ideology imposed on the industry is the death knell.. "
285,"I hoped against all odds that this article would be written from a neutral standpoint, but of course it wasn?t. This is the Times, after all?a paper I have loved and read most days of the week for over a decade, but which I can no longer trust on issues of social identity and sex. 

It is essentially assumed/implied from the outset of this piece that there is nothing wrong with the way #MeToo was conducted. Nothing wrong with destroying careers and reputations based solely on accusations, a fairly small but certain percentage of which are likely to be fabricated or exaggerated in the extreme. Nothing wrong with a movement called #OscarSoWhite. Nothing wrong with forcing filmmakers to staff their productions based first and foremost on satisfying strict quotas demanding the inclusion of women and POC and LGBT people, leaving little to no room for anyone else (AKA white males). 

The ONLY thing wrong with all this, it is strongly suggested, is the reluctance of the existing white male (even worse, OLD white males!) power structure to go along with all this, with their tails between their legs and their mouths shut. How dare they voice their opinions? Even if they are completely innocent of wrong doing, the moment they express criticism of the draconian changes being proposed, they are inevitably branded sexists and misogynists. Oh, and racists too, for good measure. Even if they didn?t say anything about race, they were probably thinking it.

288,"Could it be that the problem of dreck for content is related to lack of diversity? Research has shown time and again that diverse teams (and diverse by all kinds of measures, not just physical but of life experience) produces better work. If the ones selecting the projects right from the beginning aren?t diverse, why would we expect a good product at the end? It gets amplified all the way through the manufacturing chain. 

Been in the business for 25 years and only now am I seeing diverse sets. Oh, and it usually is on the shows that perform the best financially and creatively. Go figure. 

Happens in every industry. Just go look at financial services and tech. So a crisis is coming to Hollywood. Anyone making the product or a customer for the product should be rejoicing. "

I have seen no evidence in any new report to counter that fact.

Would it too be rude to ask how many Hollywood ""me too"" stars DID trade sexual favors for promotion at some time in their careers?"
291,"The best thing we could all do in regards to Hollywood is to just turn off our sets and read a book, or talk to each other. Go out to dinner with friends, family, or neighbors instead of watching another so-called blockbuster piece of recycled trash. Talk with each other instead of sitting in front of a shimmering screen hypnotized by mostly meaningless drivel. "
292,"It's no wonder, is it?
Take first: the Monopolisation of all studios under one control - AND: IT IS CONTROL! The same control which forced the Boy Scouts to re-admit gay scout leaders - after they had suffered abuse from 1,257 of thjose (as far as known) - and the same trend alreay vey much visible in the latest ""family films"" from the house Disney.
Take secondly that no man can dare toux=ch any woman, not even shaking hands - without the danger of ""accusations"" - or even without any hands or other implements: Jist give a film part to another actress - and the same effect.
""Me Too"" has just been, from the start a cry for ""U want that, too!"" that part, that fame, that money! ""Me Too"" is business.
And where not, it's mere Man Hate. That's why many respected and good writers and actors/actresses have kept away from - or even warned of it.
It's just a re-run of the old N.O.W. parole of their imagined ""Rape Culture"" and ""All Men Are Rapists - and That's All They Are!"" The old hate paroles of ""wimmin"" who think that 'Women' would follow them. 
They don't. More than 50% of women voted conservative. That is not ""bigot"" or ""backwards"" - it is because they love Love and Men and Children and Family.
This new ""progressive"" mould is all against that - and, therefore, indeed MOULDY.."
293,"It is bizarre to me that the commenters below completely ignore the fact that Hollywood is a market-driven industry, and that the studios have a fiduciary duty to make money for their shareholders -- not one of whom buys Time-Warner stock to support money-losing art films -- and the only reliable demographic is young men, who like to see stuff blow up. Every commenter should ask herself/himself how often they go to see a movie the first weekend (when decisions about a movie's future are decided, by theater chains and studios alike), because it was directed by a woman, or a person of color, or because it's a thoughtful adult film about a serious subject. If the answer is, as it almost certainly is for most people, ""never,"" then you are the reason Hollywood does what it does. My 26 year old nephew, who loves these comic-book adaptations, will go to the Thursday midnight showing of one of these, and if he likes it he'll go again on Saturday. So Hollywood works for him, and not for, say, me (I like Asian and European art films for the most part). This conversation is all too similar to conversations about politics in which people complain about all those dumb jerks in Washington: ""Where do they people come from?!"" we often complain. But the answer is -- we elect them. They're all our fault. We get the politics we vote for, and we get the movie culture we pay for. If you want better movies, go see them, the first weekend. If you want better politics, don't complain, vote."

296,"I watch a lot of British TV and the most noticeable thing about it, aside from the great adult oriented quality is how diverse their casting is. White people are married to black people, Muslims are in every workplace and Indian people aren?t just played for laughs. And none of this is considered anything but normal. The US has a way to go in programming. "
297,"As a minority woman,  I don't believe Hollywood needs affirmative action for women and minorities. Hollywood needs less affirmative action for white male privilege, which has been the norm in the film making business since the start, 100 years ago. Creativity and artistic merit can't be filled with quotas. But it can and should be fostered in an environment that nurtures and values diversity and inclusion. 

 And that process has to happen not only in Hollywood, but in many other industries. One thing I have encountered and observed in various industries is a hesitation amongst people of color and women in higher positions to mentor and nurture other people of color and women under them. It seems as if there's a fear of appearing biased. Considering that white men have so much power across so many industries, demonstrates that is not a major concern for them. And even then, my husband and I have found that our white colleagues and employers have done more to mentor and elevate our careers. Minorities and women should make more of an effort to support more people who have the talent and/or ability that are minorities and women. And that doesn't require excluding  white men . Netflix, BBC, and the newer networks like syfy, fx, ect, seem to get that and are experiencing real success. "

305,"I sit through previews of Hollywood movies, and they all seem to fall into a few types: action flicks consisting mostly of explosions and chases, comedies aimed at 15-year-old boys,  kids' animation, gross-out horror flicks, and endless sequels of all these titles.

I'm old enough to remember when serious movies played in  first-run theaters and made good money. There has always been mindless brain candy, but there were also films with interesting plots and actual characters.

Nowadays, nearly all my screen viewing is foreign films and TV shows. I see stories I haven't seen before, perhaps countries and cities I haven't seen before, and characters who act and look like real people. These movies stay with me, while I can't even remember the plot of the last action flick that a relative dragged me to.

I wonder if today's Hollywood executives are all business school graduates (therefore, trained but not educated) who grew up on Star Wars and other action franchises and formed their images of ideal movies in that environment.

307,"I recently read the article in NYT about concern re the pesticides in Salinas Valley, known as the ?Salad Bowl of the World?, according to the article.

What disturbed me greatly was to see that these issues that I had raised back in 2004 ? 14 years ago ? were still a horrendous issue ? in fact now more magnified.  While the article didn't go into the detail that I had in my work, at least it was focusing some attention on this horrendous, deadly issue.

At the time of my writing, 42 million pounds of pesticides were recorded to be used in the country.  Have we made any progress?

Sadly, this article records 209 million pounds of pesticides used in the state of California  in 2016.

The only progress recorded, re this article, is a new regulation that ?barred spraying close to schools or day care centers during school hours,? interpreted as a buffer zone of a quarter mile.

Too many lives, of farmworkers, their families, and those in surrounding communities, have been impacted by our failure to act. "

321,"My question is this: Is the #MeToo movement controlled by a desire for a workplace where women are respected, or is it controlled by mob justice and a desire for revenge. I am afraid that the #MeToo movement has become a witch hunt.

Two cases in point: Aziz Ansari.  He went on a date with a woman; he wanted to have sex.  While the woman did not, she did not make this unambiguous and clear to Aziz; indeed, she performed non-intercourse sex acts with him. When she finally made it clear she did not want intercourse, he let her go.  This was not sexual assualt; everything that happened that night was consensual.  Perhaps we should say it?s wrong to try to have sex on the first date, but the kinds of people who support the #MeToo witch hunt seem to be the kinds of people who think it?s somehow puritanical and repressive to suggest a return to traditional sexual norms.

Exhibit #2: Nolan Bushnell.  He did not receive a game award because of allegations of a sexually hostile workplace in the early 1970s with Atari. These allegations were done by people who were not there; when the women who were there at Atari in the 1970s spoke up (Loni Reeder, etc.), they made it emphatically clear that Nolan Bushnell respected women and that Atari was far more respectful of women than other 1970s companies.

In both cases, accusations of sexual assault happened when there was, in fact, no such assault. I support #MeToo and I support women being respected -- but we must stop the witch hunt."

324,"Ok gang, let's go over it again.

1-Sexual harassment has been outlawed in this country since app. 1980. Since then countless women (and some men) have filed complaints, sued etc. and won. I know several of them did it in my company.

2-The only thing as bad as a predator is a co depend and enabler. We started to do that right after the ground breaking change in 1980. It includes men but also many, many, many women like Anita Hill who complained yrs later despite the fact she was a lawyer. Countless women in Hollywood who complained after the roles and advancements stopped and yes many liberals and groups like M. Streep, Hillary and NOW who protected the predators as long as they were liberal and contributed to the cause.

3-Again, the only thing as bad as a predator is a co dependent or enabler. Predators live for them.

The only exception to above are minors or immigrant women who don't know the law."
325,"there are many women facing issues, but ""pervasive"" is a gross exaggeration. There are over 70,000,000 men in the workforce and the cases reported are not even 1 percent. so, deal with the issue, yes, but come on, don't let this rise to hysteria."
326,"Workplaces at large companies that have a lot to risk by not addressing these issues appropriately will change, and some have changed long ago.  But that doesn't mean sexual harassment, or harassment in general, will end.  For example, when a person doesn't care about losing their job because their job is so bad anyway (such as, say, a worker in a low level service sector) then the threat of being fired adds zero to the equation.  

Or, when a person's reputation is so shot, at least among people who care about this issue, that they can't lower the bar much further (for example, President Trump, or, say, someone previously convicted of rape) then the threat of humiliation adds nothing to the equation. 

Finally, and this is something that I find woefully missing in this whole discussion, is that general harassment happens every day, and much of it by women.  As a result, once the shock and awe of the sexual part of harassment is digested, there will be a realization that the focus on this issue is way too narrow.

Just two weeks ago I was making this point in different thread, and sure enough later that day I got harassed by a woman on my way home from work in the subway, despite being polite and curteous. I'm thinking of starting a video collection to show how pervasive this behaviour is, and maybe those people will get fired for their behavior. "
327,"""We can't fire our way out of this problem.""  Are we sure?  Should we try?  Cultures are hard to change.  Socialization is hard to undo in adults.  Behavior, however, is subject to modification based on incentives, risks and rewards.  Do we need to make harassment and abuse riskier, and the consequences more certain?  Can we do more to reward positive behavior by men in the workplace?"
328,"Accusations of misbehavior of any kind have never been grounds for complete dismissal, only investigation. And accusers who won't pursue legal action have no grounds, and should not be listened to, period. ANYONE can make accusations. The day-care scandals are a perfect example of how lives can be destroyed for no good reason. Having a good reason does not justify public shaming and trial by media. Sadly, people never learn anything, because each generation knows less instead of more. The ends do not justify the means. Slander, gossip, personal attacks are age-old weapons women use, and it does not demonstrate equality or emotional maturity to use them now. I suspect this whole ""movement"" was derived from PETA's terrorist tactics, given the Hollywood connections behind it all. I hope we soon see the men fighting back. Criminal behavior should be punished criminally. Women constantly prove, if anyone is looking, that they are no better than men."

330,"Excellent article, but yet again doesn't really address root causes.  It correctly notes harassment will be hard to end & that problems are systemic & pervasive, but doesn't ask why.  Aren't we programmed to learn from day we're born?  As adults don't we all have tastes & habits that are hard to change, even though much can be modified & we continue to learn for life?  The comments correctly note: harassment is about power & entitlement & that behavior is cultural, Issues are systemic, pervasive, provocative dressing is a factor, & kindness & compassion are needed.  Doesn't this all reflect that learned mindset is key, meaning power of indoctrination (including paternalism)?  The NYT came close to addressing all above when on front page they linked attitude of father of drunk Stanford student (given 6 mo. jail for raping unconscious drunk woman) said ""too much punishment for 20min. of exercise.""
    Since we agree kids mostly learn what they live, shouldn't all policies (gov't, organizations, schools, etc) be linked to affects on kids? How about fact legal system is determined by Who CAN Win Vs What Is Fair, no matter the topic, worst when hurts kids? WHY aren't all media alerting public to fact Congress has been sitting since July 24, 2107 on bill, H.Con.Res.72 re safety 1st of kids of divorce?  It's compassionate & constructive vs pointing fingers.  Most of Europe has such laws.  Credible data shows family courts order 58,000 kids/yr to abusive custody/visits. CPS is worse."
331,"All forms of harassment whether it be sexual, racial, political, economic, etc. need to be addressed because they create an unhealthy work, school, worship, etc. environment.

334,"Some men do behave badly but then some women also make accusations over a misconstrued word .

Yes there should be laws that guarantee women equal pay for equal work . Boorish men will always be around , it is ingrained behavior , you can shame them , you can have them fired , you can shun them but you cannot change them . Perhaps the beginning should start at home where a sense of right from wrong is taught along with how to tie your shoes."
335,"
For a woman to be fired due to her actions to stop sexual harassment is pure cowardice. A man, who felt threatened, can't even own up to his own actions so he must rid of the evidence by firing his victim. Oh, the irony; he didn't feel safe so he rid of the problem. If only it was that easy for women in the workplace. Instead, they are often silenced, accused of falsifying a story, or just plainly ignored. It is an awful feeling to be surrounded by an environment of belittling coworkers whom you are meant to learn from, not suffer because of.
 It amazes me that the MeToo movement is the backbone behind the purpose of these new laws. Inequality in the workforce has been an issue for decades, but when women's lives over dignity are at risk, something is done. This proves the reason that women are growing in power and influence. People are starting to realize that we need women to get the job done, because they are just as valued as men."
336,"If we recall Susan Brownmiller's assertion that rape is about power, not sex, it would follow that sexual harassment is also about power. To build on Tony's comments below, employers have been systematically disempowering their employees for decades now, and we shouldn't be surprised that sexual harassment is one consequence. It also shouldn't surprise us that harassment complaints would result in the firing or further humiliation of the less-powerful person complaining, and impunity if not a promotion for the more-powerful harasser -- even if the middling-powered woman (usually) in HR might wish otherwise. Treating employees as full human beings in all ways in the workplace would help greatly in combating sexual harassment."
337,"If you want to change the culture, you have to start with the future. Educating our kids and young people on appropriate and respectful behavior. Its been generations of ""boys will be boys"" excuse making and blame the victim attitudes. We can't expect corporations and legal actions to cure this problem. You have to root it out before it starts by changing culture attitudes of our future generations. "

Of course, the field of bioethics is vast and there are a large number of fascinating topics one could focus on beyond the topics you mention (research ethics, animal welfare and environmental ethics come to mind immediately), but in any course one must pick and choose.  Plus, there's something to be said for a more narrow, topical focus even in a intro course; it may be better than covering a lot of topics superficially.

As for teaching approach - I would just say that, rather than broad policy questions like ""should we permit genetic engineering"", it is often helpful to use more particular case scenarios - as with the Deaf selection case.  This makes issues more tractable and relevant, emphasizing bioethics is not an abstract discipline.  It also highlights the importance of contextual factors in many of these debates.  This is particularly true for professional adult learners, whose interests will typically be more practical rather than theoretical."

Imagine if the internet had existed then; it probably would have consumed the haters' time so thoroughly nobody could have gone to school, work, or attended to their families.
So now we have a plethora of rabid anti-Semitism online that dwarfs the printed versions. And we have a plethora of unbalanced, but outwardly ""normal"" men who measure their manliness by the amount of powerful rifles and guns they own.
So tell me, NRA diehards (I am not against all gun ownership, but how many does an individual need, and why does anyone need an AR-15, outside of the police or armed forces?) - how can you ignore the stash of weapons of mass murder owned by virulent racists, anti-Semites, or suicidal people who want to kill themselves after they first hunt down a large number of ordinary people first?

In a desperate bid to preserve traditional powers to shape public discourse, the media is now advocating for China-esque monitoring and censorship of the internet. "
370,"I applaud Mr. Staunton for undertaking the task of Sisyphus. I am also an immigrant, although my family, refugees from WWII in war-torn France, came in legally on a Victory ship in 1946 and were logged into the roll at Ellis Island. We easily became citizens in 1952, in a ceremony I remember quite vividly, at the Federal Southern District Court in NYC. Anti-immigrant types will tell you that those who came in ""by the rules"" as we did have the same harsh view of illegals as they do. It's a lie. I welcome any immigrant or refugee who wants to come here to better himself and improve his children's future. I only fear that they may be too late and that the hatred we see in this country may be irreversible in the age of social media. And while I totally agree that ?It is un-American to pull the ladder up after you,"" I think that is what immigrants have always done. It's what I refer to as the ""Ladder theory of American social democracy"": viz., people come here escaping persecution, discrimination, war, famine, pestilence and poverty and end up in the slime at the bottom of the entry pool. With diligence they pull themselves up to the first, then the second, rung of the ladder. Now, having adequate purchase, they keep a foot and a hand on the ladder. With their free hand they wave the American flag and with their free foot they kick at whoever is below, trying to keep them in the slime they have just left. Sadly, that is who we are."
371,"People think that only blacks and people from Mexico have been discriminated against. In this country, unfortunately, every culture has been discriminated against at some time in history. The Irish, the Jews, Chinese, Japanese (I once saw an exhibit in a museum where there was a chart so that immigration officials could tell the difference between the Chinese and the Japanese. They were only allowed to open up certain businesses here, which was another form of discrimination. The idea is to fight such hatred and realize that we're all the same  - we all want the best for our families, food on the table, clothes on our backs and a roof over our head. Do I agree with giving help through social programs to people that come here? No - my grandparents came here through Ellis Island and had to have a job and a place to live or they would have been sent back."

I found out I was adopted when I was 30 years-old, & subsequently discovered my birth-mother's very German last name on my adoption papers. For 30 years I thought I was half-Cuban and half Czech - even though I did not look Cuban - at all. I was ""German"" the whole time (according to Family Tree DNA, however, 99% of me is from the ""British Isles""). My foundation & identity changed in an instant & it was an unsettling experience to live through. I didn't want to be adopted-I wanted to be the unique, blonde-haired, green-eyed half-Cuban/half-Czech girl that I thought I was. I still don't know if my wonderful Cuban cousins know if I was adopted & I am terrified to even ask! I'm thrilled I have met my birth mother & excited about learning a new history & dimension of my existence, but it's been a rough 20 years not knowing where I came from or who my ""people"" were.

In the Bible, (especially the Old Testament) a book mostly written by Jews for Jews, it was the various tribe of the Jewish nation that God was mostly supposed to have favored.
Apparently, there were prohibitions rendered for fraternizing with others outside of the cultural norms.
In part, I can only conclude that even circumcizing of baby boys  on the eight-day was their way of knowing/identifying which babies (babies tend to look a lot alike when first born)
were the Jewish babies and of course, the boys were more valuable than the females at the time.
In today's world, what was seeming a religious norm has changed into something uglier, with the lighter skins populace given a societal boost of prosperity than the darker skinned counterparts.
We are who we are as we are all parts of our environment.
If one is reared black, then that what's you are, who you identify as.
As I read about the various DNA test, I see there is no such thing as a pure race, it brought to mind a line from the show of yesterday, the Wonder Days in which the Kevin character mused, 'we're mutts', as his mother attempted to explain their genealogy to a misunderstood question by her son.

Hence our success as a species and the hope that we can, indeed, survive Climate Change (at least as a species). The reality is that heritage and ethnicity are more about self-identity and ego (psychology, in the benevolent sense) than human genomic reality. Our genomes vary by about 3% on average. That means we're all much more alike than different. The fact that some of those polymophisms have begat different skin colors and other physical features that we relate to ""race"" doesn't really mean that the different human cohorts that arose through geographical separations are really, fundamentally that different. The bottom line is that we're all ""African"" in our human origins and we should remember and celebrate that basic bond among all of us, just as we cherish our different ethnicities and cultures."

I have a slew of cousins all over Eastern Canada and the U.S. My DNA pegs me as Acadian, French/Irish.  Initially, I grappled heavily with a feeling of guilt towards my (adoptive) folks... wondering how they would feel about me embracing my Acadian French/Irish heritage, my relationship with my father, who by the way, is lovely, and my new-old family... But then I came to the conclusion that it is so good to know where you are from, but that doesn't make you who you are.  I read in your article:   ""Our identity is what grounds us and gives our lives meaning,?  And also:  ?We seek out and cultivate identities to fill our need to belong, and it?s through that lens of identity that we see and understand the world,? I loved that. After some soul-searching and trying on my 'new-old identity', I realized, like so many of us, I am a glorious blend... as I age and grow, my need to 'belong' is diminishing... It is 'through the lens of identity that we see and understand the world', but I feel that is open to change based on age and life experience.  I have embraced the marvelous and rich blend of my heritage coupled together with my upbringing.  It's a very good feeling."

Yes, I was Italian, Irish, and English, but also Turkish, Spanish, unspecified other Middle Eastern, Northern African and a tiny bit European Jewish!  I felt so worldly and exotic. About a year later, though, Ancestry updated its results. Turns out I am Italian (49%, specifically, from Calabria), Irish (43%, from Galway), and English (West Yorkshire).

Ancestry uses a more generalized method even though, with female DNA they only have the maternal side. In 23andMe I am 98% Ashkenazi Jew. In Ancestry I am 91%. I assume part of the difference is due to the specific material tested and the difference in method."

412,"Giving landlords the power to control access to someone's apartment will invariably lead to civil rights violations.  According to the article: ""Landlords are considering the technology as a replacement for their tenants? key fobs...""

When you rent an apartment you are paying for unfettered access to your home.  If you allow a third party to control access to your home, then you will automatically see those in control of the lock begin to demand concessions for entry.  This will range from simple harassment for not cleaning the lint trap in the clothes dryer, to lock-outs for late rent, to services in the back room.

This has now become standard practice in the budget hotel industry.  Invariably, the electronic key-card no longer works after a few days stay in the hotel, which requires a trip to the front desk.  They always tell you that you damaged the key card, but in reality they've initially programmed the card to bring you back to the desk (ostensibly because bank might have reversed your credit card payment since checking-in).  This requires a twenty minute trip to the front desk every evening.  The hotel doesn't care less about wasting your time.

I also saw something similar in action at the Salvation Army Harbor Lights facility in Minneapolis.  There the county health service operates a clinic located behind the front door.  But the people at the front desk work for the Salvation Army, and require everybody to be searched and breathalyzed before entry."

Admitedly, Kretchmer is less known in America, but his theories are nonetheless valid. Personalities are not easy things to determine, and we need all the data we can get."
439,"The author is not conflating facial recognition with anything, but establishing the history of misuse physically identifiable features with human behaviour, and risks involved which play to scientifically proven age old human bias.
You don't need AI to know mischaracterising an argument then claiming misspeaking  is a tell for someone with an agenda. In this case, it's most likely seeking funding for a research or development project, if it's not straight up tr trying to sell one of these bogus systems..."
440,"This article misses the current abuse of facial recognition in China for surveillance for a ""social credit score"" and to suppress minorities.  These systems aren't even close to 95% accuracy in identification so to suppose they can evaluate character, criminality, sexual orientation or emotions is ridiculous."
441,"The more often you are correctly identified by facial recognition, the less likely that it will make a mistake. I went through customs of two countries and both used facial recognition to identify me. In both cases, after the machine determined that I am who I say I am, then I went to the human that stamped my passport.

As for using facial recognition to determine character or personality, complete nonsense. Humans can find patterns in known random data, no doubt so can computers. Finding a temporary pattern is not a reliable indicator of anything."
442,"The Italian anthropological criminologist Cesare Lombroso (1800s) was a pseudo scientific racist. (One predictive indicator of criminal intent was the slope of the forehead).  My experience as a trial investigator in criminal cases leads me to suspect that the vast unreliability of eyewitnesses to interracial crime is also driven by an implicit belief in anthropological criminology.  Some uncertain eyewitnesses pick a photo from a lineup based on skull characteristics, posture, etc.  They won?t admit that implicit racial bias.  Dr. Liz Loftus (UC Irvine) has written widely about eyewitness identification issues."
443,Face it. We are falling fast into Dystopia where junk technology supplants junk science at our altar of progress.

446,"On the other hand, human-designed faces can be almost a fool-proof way of detecting villainy.  Refer to Disney and others."
447,"The author of this article is using a trick- conflating two completely different activities (using facial recognition to identify individuals, and using similar technologies to make value judgements about groups of people).  the former is a legit technique, the latter is not.  Conflating them intentionally like this is trying to convince people the former is wrong.  I note from the comments that most people have picked up on this rhetorical trick,"
448,"Eyewitnesses to crimes usually try hard to correctly identify an offender in police photo and in-person line-ups.  Oftentimes, they misidentify a suspect and an innocent person is convicted.  Sometimes the lineup is tainted by detective malfeasance, more subtly, implicit biases in the eyewitness influence the process. Those implicit biases are frequently grounded in the eyewitness? tacit acceptance of anthropological criminology where facial characteristics are indicators of guilt. Maybe the skull structure validates the misidentification as a confirmation bias. There are subconscious heuristics leading the eyewitness to incriminate an innocent man or woman.  As a criminal trial investigator over ten years, I observed this often in vetting eyewitnesses before trial.  Dr. Elizabeth Loftus at UC Irvine is a respected expert, has written often about her research.  

She is not among the rogue pseudo-science criminologists (like Cesare Lombroso) that misuse junk science to condemn classes of people because of their forehead shape."
449,"If we put a cop by the entrance to a stadium and he recognizes a man from a wanted poster--how is this different from having an electronic device recognize him? Even if there is an error, we wouldn't accept a legally consequential recognition based only on a cop's recollection of a poster or an algorithm. Is it an invasion of privacy to be recognized in a public place?

An invasion of privacy problem may begin after recognition, if a company (most likely) or the government sets about recording legal movement or behavior."
450,This article has a lot of conclusions without a lot of backup.  I was waiting for the studies that used AI to debunk these claims that personality and physiology are related.  But seems we don?t have them yet because none are cited.
451,"Two different ideas presented here: the ridiculous notion that behavior can be ?predicted? by facial recognition and the legitimate use of facial recognition for ?identification? of known criminals.  As with any identification or surveillance system, there are legitimate privacy concerns for law abiding citizens.  Having to present identification before voting, for example, is a reasonable invasion of privacy if one wishes to prevent those not eligible from voting.  The same is true of firearms registration and driving privileges.  The constant fear is that the government will abridge our rights in the name of the ?common good?.  AI technology increases their ability to do exactly that.  Sadly, that?s already a reality."
452,"It is silly to compare older 19th century technology and methods to today?s machine learning which can learn patterns, some we can?t even recognize.

If a pattern is there, it is there. 

If a pattern is not there, it is not."
453,"ICE cannot act without a valid legal authority to do this facial recognition search or indeed anything else.  We are not talking about the Gestapo or KGB here.  I work on hundreds of criminal cases brought in by ICE, our sister agency, and they all have a tale of heinous crime to tell.  Heroin, fentanyl, cocaine seizures with millions of dollars in drug proceeds, countless lethal weapons of every description, properties purchased with the drug proceeds...and guess who many of the perpetrators are?  Illegals in Chicago.  Let ICE do its good work and turn off the Boo Hoo Machine of political correctness already."
454,"I was astonished returning recently from London, with my passport, using the ICE app to expedite entry, to have the Immigration Officer take my picture.

I?ve only had this when I have entered totalitarian countries when I had a valid, Embassy issued visa to that country.

Why is MY government taking MY picture returning to MY when I have a valid, allegedly secure passport with an RFID chip on it which, with me standing in front of him, my passport open, a quick swipe confirms the picture in the passport matches the data in their data base already, are they apparently compiling a NEW data base?

And why driver?s licenses?

Now it makes sense about the Real ID program:  Homeland Security wants to abridge the right of every American to be secure in their persons and property, including their unique image, without a warrant.   A clear violation of the Fourth Amendment."
455,"The question here is not the immediate act by ICE but the danger of all government agencies making broad searches leading to multiple false positives. Remember, we are more likely to ?believe? a computer making it twice as hard to prove innocence. Also consider the burdens and impacts on life cause by what are potentially millions of false positives - false accusations. 

We are moving towards dangerous times. It is time to check government power before it grows out of control. Just look at China! Remember, it?s usually the guy that says  ?I have nothing to worry about because I did nothing wrong? that ends up regretting that statement."
456,"As the legislative manager of California's 1986 Personal Information Integrity Act -- which was defeated by the intervention of the late Sen. Ed Davis, formerly LAPD's corrupt policy chief -- I'm not surprised by the offenses against personal privacy being inaugurated by law enforcement agencies.  Peeking into private places and recording all they can about citizens -- innocent until proven guilty --  is a habit ingrained in these organizations' make-up.  It is their primary modus operandi.  

Can it be long before we can expect interrogations based on nothing more than looking like ... whomever?  

And when will the giant platforms be called to answer for their private brand of trespassing and information collecting, perhaps in cahoots with ""law enforcement""?  

These occasional sensational news articles need constant follow-ups to raise Americans' consciousness of what's happening and what's at stake -- our basic freedoms to go about our business and live our lives, to pursue happiness, without constant worry that we may be held culpable for a crime --  or simply hanging out with the ""wrong"" people -- because some hair-brain in ICE or the local police cadet thinks we're not who we are.  

Why are we under surveillance in the first place?   I don't see that in the Constitution.  On the contrary, the Supreme Court has ruled we each are entitled to a personal privacy by the First Amendment. So why is all this happening?  And what can we do about it?  Now, before it's too late!"
457,"Simpletons complain --
""why are they looking at me -- and my physical data --
when I have done nothing wrong""?

Because,
until they look at you -- and your physical data --
they have no way to distinguish you from someone else who has done something wrong.

The real issue is the technical reliability of the ID system.

Most importantly, how many ""false positives""?
What is the rate of ""false positives""?

A good ID system will have low ""false positives"".

The test for biometric data stored digitally and accessed electronically
is no different from the test for data written in pencil and paper and stored in rooms of file cabinets and scanned with hundreds of pairs of eyeballs --

Namely,
How many false positives?
What is the rate of false positives?

Much better  to search for someone accurately matched to biometric digital data
than to search for someone who is Race X, skin color Y,
eye color Z height H and ""build"" B."
458,"I am a liberal, moderate democrat and I do not understand how people who are here illegally can get a drivers license. I have compassion, I believe that people seeking amnesty need to have basic rights and systematic support, but certain rights and privileges should be extended only to those who are here legally and follow the laws of the US."
459,"ICE is a police agency.
Police agencies share information with each other all the time.
I see much less downside to information sharing among government police agencies than among private companies.
If ICE or any other police agency starting sharing information with any private company (other than as required for performance of a government contract), then that would be a serious problem.

If some states or local jurisdictions want to get obstreperous and refuse to co-operate with ICE, that is fine so long as it does not violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S.Constitution.
Of course, the federal government might start denying information to state and local agencies, and in that case, the Supremacy Clause would not put any limit on the refusal.

In any case, Congress does have power to regulate the information sharing -- whether requiring it, permitting it or prohibiting it.
And, in the absence of Congressional action, then the courts will decide, case-by-case.

BTW. All you progressive/lefties --
Be careful what you wish for when it comes to non-co-operation with the federal government.
Maybe the IRS stops sharing tax information with state and local governments.
Maybe the federal government prohibits state and local governments from requiring anybody to produce a U.S. federal tax return or other federal tax information."
460,I don?t like this one bit. There is no way this could be used against us given the illegal intrusion of phone records following 9-11. RIGHT!!? As long as Trump and McConnell are in power we aren?t free from this possible weapon against us.
461,"What could possibly go wrong?!
Ohhh, right: now undocumented immigrants are going to go without licenses. How stupid and shortsighted this government is and how blissfully ignorant of the laws of unintended consequences."
462,"I have a Hispanic last name and am a second generation American.  When I go to Europe on vacation I always get get pulled by I don't know  what agency at the airport when I reenter the US, only to be let go later because my name has been confused with some one else's.  Is it only a matter of time where the same thing will happen with these searches?  Only this time will I be placed in a detension center?"
463,"For the life of me, I cannot understand the logic behind all the people who are appalled at this (I understand that it's Red vs Blue... but I just don't see the logic).

It's not like people are being photographed and documented without their consent... they are voluntarily giving their photo and information to a government entity. Did they really not think that information wouldn't be used to track them if they committed a crime? How is this any different than an FBI or ICE agent looking at DMV records manually? This simply automates the process. Quite frankly it's a good idea. Saves taxpayer dollars on labor costs.

And let's not forget - illegal entry into the US is still a crime - one that Democrats were strongly against in the Obama days. Not sure what's happened to them since then..."
464,"This is just the tip of the iceberg! 
It is, however, an indication of what's to come from a government run by authoritarian oligarchs like the Koch's, the Mercers, the trumps, Murdoch/Fox, etc., etc..
These trends began in the early 21 century and they are now coming to fruition. That means George Orwell was off by 20   years and that's a fairly good sense of prescience!"
465,We need an omnibus Federal privacy bill that provides unambiguous boundaries for individual privacy in the physical and digital realm. It also needs teeth for violators.
466,"Note that this happened..when liberals were in control of the White House.. isn't funny that we accuse China and it Huawei that they are ganna do us..what we are doing? Lookup the PRISM project on Wikipedia guys. What we know that they did 11 years ago is mind boggling, how about what they are doing now?"
467,"Our Republic is Of, By, and For the People, and WE did not agree to ANY of this. I think Amendments 3 and 4 would apply in this day and age --- to ALL surveillance, information gathering going on (Intel, military, commercial, etc.) at home, and otherwise -- and require due process. Moreover, there is no need for any surveillance, or otherwise intrusion rights, to be granted except in regards to the criminal justice system, with cause. Someone should sue -- if I could afford to, I would!"
468,"One of the problems with giving illegal aliens drivers license is the fact that the US uses Drivers' license as access to other places forbidden to illegal aliens.

Driver's licenses are used to access Public and Federal buildings, at airports etc. 

The US would be better off if they copied the European Model where citizens have ID cards  and driver's licenses are ONLY used for Driving."
469,"I think that if ""ICE"" were renamed ""CARES"" (Customs and Refugee/Emigree Service"", or something like that, it might stop attracting the kind of schadenfreude people who currently seem to dominate the culture at ICE."
470,"There?s an easy solution. The 29 states that haven?t authorized federal agencies to scan driver?s licenses should join the 21 states that have. If some decline, serial killers, murderers, rapists, bank robbers, illegal immigrans and other criminal  who fear driver?s license scans my lead to their apprehension should build move to the states that refuse  law enforcement agencies access to driver?s license databases."
471,"Homeland Security is now photographing US (and other) citizens upon return to the US from foreign travel. I would be amazed if these photo's were not being subjected to facial recognition algorithms and stored forever. Isn't it about time to start massively scaling back these organizations by defunding them? We are looking at a staggering deficit after all, and we know how upsetting that is to Republicans."
472,"While I believe it's unacceptable and an invasion of my privacy that my ID was run by ICE/the FBI, that's clearly my opinion; however, it's fact that they used software determined to be most innacurate in identifying the very groups they are trying to identify. At this rate, should we start defoliating with Agent Orange again? Bad science should be taught so that we don't repeat mistakes, but it should never be practiced. Using facial recognition for this use has been determined to be, at best, bad science."
473,"Let's face it.  There is no longer any privacy for the average American resident, citizen or not, criminal or not.  The only reason they are likely to leave me alone is because I have gray hair and usually ""old ladies"" are not criminals.  But I don't like this and I hope the next administration will stop it."
474,"I see that the Right and Trumpists are continuing their policy of Big Gov can only be trusted when I want stuff, deficits and debts don?t matter once Republicans take charge, a war isn?t a war if Trump starts it, executive orders only destroy Amurrica when Obama issues them, the Constitution only says what I say it says, and Jesus only counts on Sunday mornings."
475,"And this too shall pass.  Until Democrats boldly step up with new and creative ways to capture the media, Trump will control the narrative.  Have the Democrats ever thought about appointing a Press Secretary?  Someone charismatic, smart, funny, and articulate.  Every time Trump lies or puts forth an appalling policy (and this will be every day), this Press Secretary will hold a press conference. If this Press Secretary is compelling, she will grab the attention of the media, and thus, the nation."
476,"Search any name online and there are sites (mylife.com for example) that gives a fairly good  intro including date of birth.

Looks like none of our personal info is safe and it will never be hidden again.   How much more control will data have over us?  Why aren't we riled up and demanding privacy?  Why are government agencies so willing to sell our information and then let us scrambling as we run for cover?

No wonder we can be scammed and shamed so easily.  It's all out there for anyone's viewing pleasure and devious pursuits."
477,"One of the significant risks here is a false match.  A U.S. citizen could be identified as an undocumented immigrant, rounded up by ICE and detained for months in one of their concentration camps before finally being released once the mistaken identity is clarified.  Contemplate this.  AI facial recognition is far from perfect."
478,Good for Axon.  Tech finally acting like grownups.
479,"I just want the crime problem in my city addressed. Does anyone in their right mind think the status quo vague descriptions of suspects by eyewitnesses is better? (""White male, late 50s, brown hair, wearing jeans -- be on the lookout"" or ""black teen, dark complexion, wearing a hoodie -- be on the lookout."") The irony is academics, criminal justice skeptics and yes leftist fanatics have written, debated, and screamed ad nauseum about flaws in eye-witness testimony. Yet now an A.I. solution is deemed ""problematic."" And let's be real: Media also talks ad nauseum about ""innocents"" caught up in ""the system,"" but hardly ever talk about ""the system"" letting go a bona fide criminal, which happens far more often. Fear mongering articles on facial recognition without exception fail to mention that prosecutors have been getting confessions and convictions for a very long time based partly on identifications by humans, for instance in lineups or in mug books, or by police officers. Worst case scenario facial recognition systems have succeeded in partly automating what human witnesses do. These mechanized comparison systems exhibit occasional errors. But guess what? People, whose testimony is well known to be unreliable, and it is not clear that it's any better than the dreaded machines. The point is that facial recognition is as likely or more to be accurate as traditional methods based on human identification that have been used for centuries to finger criminal suspects."
480,"I am not sure I understand why facial recognition is even truly useful for police body cams.  Body cams are there to protect the public from police abuse that otherwise would not be noted.  

If a police officer is close enough to a person to get a clear image then the officer should be able to decide whether to apprehend that person based on their actions without knowing their identity.  

If this technology is used to attempt to identify persons with open warrants among those casually captured by the officer's camera, then we enter a parlous state.

In the reasonable future the body cams are not likely to have the processing power and battery life to be sufficiently useful for this purpose as standalone cameras.  More powerful computers connected by a wireless net would be needed, with the attendent issues of reliability and security."
481,When your wife or daughter is sexually assaulted by serial perpetrator who otherwise would have been incarcerated - thank this shortsighted silliness.
482,coz their AI sucks. afraid of getting sued for biiiiig bucks
483,Barr could use facial technology to identify political dissidents when Trump loses in 2020 and voids the election. What is a dictator facing jail time supposed to do just leave no fight to the  end democracy be damned .
484,"It's coming, not a question of if but of when.  In the carceral state, where there is money to be made by locking people up, something like this is just too juicy an opportunity to pass up."
485,"The concern over facial recognition software is way overblown.

Facial recognition is used only to identify possible participants; then ordinary investigatory methods are employed.  It is not evidence, just an investigatory tool.

Indeed:  Has there ever been a case where facial recognition per se was the compelling evidence in a conviction?"
486,"I am dumbfounded but wholly encouraged by Axon's ban on the use of facial recognition technology in their security product. I kept asking myself as I read through Mr. Warzel's article, ""What gives? What's the catch?"". 

But if more governing entities begin to follow San Francisco's lead, as this article seems to indicate they are, and thus the sales environment more challenging, then Axon's move would appear less about taking an ethical stand then it is about having the prescience to bowing to the inevitable."
487,"Facial tech out, eyewitness testimony and hand drawn sketches in.  That makes no sense.  Idiocracy was not a satire.  It was a documentary that somehow made its way to our time."
488,"The Minority Report  movie and Pre Crime was prescient.

I bet we build bigger prisons."
489,Definitely a positive step by Axon. Clearly this technology is not ready for prime time. In that way it is similar to self-driving cars. If facial recognition technology can ever be made reliable enough then the question becomes where should it be used and where should it be banned. Facial recognition is obviously a potentially dangerous technology with regard to a free society and citizens need to get involved in the decision-making process.
490,"I think the key here is that the body cameras available, in the light typically available, just can't do it.

If other tech could, so what? This still can't.

If other tech can't either, that just proves more so that this tech can't be expected to do it.

Could any tech ever overcome that? Should it? Should we then use it? 

Police body cam makers are not answering those questions. Perhaps the rest of us should, before we get there and just do it anyway."
491,"Many police officers can in fact recognize the criminals in their assigned areas, particularly if they've arrested them several times already."
492,Facial recognition is more accurate than eye witnesses.  Maybe we should not allow testimony of witnesses of a crime until people can be proven reliable.
493,"Surely they jest...

Looking how systemically unreliable all types of ""evidence"" are, today ? will take my chances with what a camera sees me doing, vs what an eyewitness claims...

So long as it?s not selectively excerpted...

Further, as a country, we're about as interested in upgrading the confidence of evidence gathered for trials ? as pharmas are in driving down the prices of their meds...

(even with rape kits, DNA testing, and body cameras - the predominant trend is to ditch them when no one's looking)

Flying under the radar, prosecutors wield a discretion to punish or pummel or pulverize that'd make any 13th century counterpart envious...

Think of our big new country like a big new plane...

If you're going to decide what really happened or going on, based on what the crowd thinks ? it won't turn out well...

Especially when the crowd clamors for a fair trial, followed by a graphic and gruesome execution...

Or when the royals see no criminal act ? and focus on smoothing over the economic fallout...

Dean/AG, let me ask you this...

Would you all have had even 3% of the insight as to what went down with Khashoggi ? if no cameras around...

PS

Simplest fail-safe would be this...

The AI bot will gladly tell you the confidence level of the identification...

Based on that, convene a grand jury...

Or, simpler ? a pop-up panel of 3-5 human experts, to render a decision within 2 hours of first viewing..."
494,"Privacy and video scanning
With the information given I am not very concerned about video scanning. It could be good and it could be bad, but most likely both.  The one overwhelming question is How Much Does It Cost.  Protecting the privacy of citizens once seemed like a good idea.  But after mountains of paperwork, slowing down the purchase of medications, the machines that collect your signature everywhere and the software that runs it all, it is obvious that the costs in the USA are in the low Billions of dollars per year.  Billions per year. Once again, the lawyers won and the common tax payers now have less money. Paranoia is very popular and heavily used to make this additional bill that everyone is paying, as large as possible. However, it could, instead, be paying for free early childhood daycare with healthy food.  We would see a Return On Investment in the very first year, with huge benefits 20 years from now. Where this has been done, (Northern Europe) they rent out their empty prisons to countries that offer less early childhood socialization support. Money does not grow on trees and needs to be spent carefully."
495,"Hmmm. Here's what I've learned after a couple of decades in business. If someone says the data isn't good enough to rely on it, 95% of the time they just don't like the data. Then when they say, ""not another word about this topic"" and ""it won't happen for years"" I smell something really fishy.  That's when I know there's really a deeper story there. In my next life I'll be an investigative reporter."
496,"Hurray!  Good news!  Something I can smile about when I share it with other people!  Thank you for reporting it, Mr. Warzel!"
497,"A false arrest can be devastating and is actually harder to erase than some convictions. Such arrests show up on many employment background checks and rental application background checks, and for young people, it crucially must be disclosed when joining the military or applying for many government jobs. 

Once someone is ""In the system"" they never truly leave, even if they are just booked and released almost immediately when their true identity is discovered."
498,"Just flat out take, store and peruse a picture. Recognition software not necessary. And when are we going to take as many pictures of the police as of the general public in police encounters?"
499,"I'm more than a little confused about this co-called privacy issue and the way it's being discusses by journalists. In all these articles on privacy, journalists seem to believe that before facial recognition and other means of data gathering, our lives out in public were private. They weren't private. They were public. Even back before cameras, if the police wanted to know something about us, they went to our friends to find out what places we frequented and asked people in the establishment if they had seen us there. They relied on people's memories and business records. They didn't need a warrant to get the information either. Even what we put up in FaceBook, twitter or Instagram, etc. are all public forums. This is public information, not private. Our data has always been public. It was just more difficult to gather until the last couple of decades. Facial recognition has always been available to the police. It just resided within the memories of the people who had seen us, and the police gathered this information and didn't need a warrant to get it. Police abuse of the information they gathered was always a possibility. And the problem of facial recognition didn't start with this new technology being unreliable. I think this privacy discussion is being dumbed down by journalist to such an extent that it's obscuring the real issues surrounding the gathering of our individual public data, and it's leading to bad public policies."
500,"I have to infer from the reasoning that when and if facial recognition becomes very accurate, the ethics board will then recommend its use ? Is that ethical?"
501,"This is what a responsible decision looks like though I really am not sure if this is a one-time decision which will be later abandoned for a wonderful, shiny Mark of the Beast? 
(just kidding . . . maybe)"
502,"Good news, at least for now, for the US.

UK police forces have enthusiastically embraced AFR technology. Yesterday, the UK Government's own Biometrics regulator described the roll out by British police forces as 'chaotic' and commented that its application was 'running ahead of laws that could prevent its misuse'

""With no legal framework in place it was left to the police to decide when the public benefit outweighed the ?significant intrusion into an individual?s privacy? arising from facial recognition and other types of biometric identification"", the report said.

Civil liberties groups have also raised the issue of false arrest due to mis-identification.

Scary. This sort of thing is going to rule our lives."
503,The plot of Person of Interest edges closer to nonfiction.  Will US citizens be subject to a Correction or Sorting one day?  Those who know the tech intimately might be trying to curtail that.
504,"Looks as if most of the comments line up squarely behind this technology, with many claiming that liberals and the ACLU are behind banning it.

All those folks, especially the law-abiding ones, should march right down and give a DNA sample to their local police force.  You know, just in case it's ever needed."
505,"It' not potential abuse it's real abuse. We see it in the way DNA is used to track criminals through far removed relatives to then zero in on a someone who has escaped the law for many years but now is brought to justice. The problem though is that the privacy of every other extended family member has been violated.  It seems at first blush that justice has been served but at a terrible price. The price of privacy and the right to live without government intrusion.  
We see what is happening in China were there are millions of cameras that zoom in on private citizens to monitor their behavior. Then they are ridiculed or punished publicly for offenses that in a country in Western Europe or the United States or Canada would hardly be noticed.  
The DNA tracking and the cameras have much in common.  They operate behind the scenes without restriction or supervision.  And they operated subversively and unobtrusively in the lives of ordinary and private citizens.
George Orwell's 1984 has arrived and grows.  Where will government intrusion end and the right of privacy end too?  
We have read recently of a number of unsolved crimes that have finally after decades been resolved because of DNA. What if after decades a government agency records a citizen in a comprising situation, not necessarily criminal, but like China, seemingly a threat to orderly conduct and a docile, compliant society?  How many lives will be ruined by this intrusion and control? The risks out weigh the benefits."
506,"I believe surveillance like this has been in use in England for some time.
A good subject for a study of the effects both good and bad ?"
507,In what sense do I or anyone else have a reasonable expectation of privacy when out in public? Isn't it the essence of being in a public place that other people (including law enforcement) can be there too and recognize you?
508,Terrorists and criminals rejoice! San Francisco will now be THEIR sanctuary city.
509,After being pickpocketed twice and seeing three purse-snatchings in board daylight it is about time that someone put a stop to these habitual criminal activities.   The police can?t be everywhere and they are never where you really need.
510,"Lots of luck finding criminals with scant evidence.  It is going to be a ""first-class goat rope"" bringing perpetrators to justice.  Typical San Francisco.  they can take the credi9t for things going WRONG in our society.  Remember, if you have nothing to hide do not worry about the camera."
511,"Dumbest thing I've heard of in a long time.  Does San Francisco recognize that this technology is used to not only catch the bad guy, but also to avoid crime?  Most terrorists caught in London, Germany, France, and other countries would not have been possible without it.  Understand we don't want government following us around (as if they don't already do that via Obamacare, Internet, social networks, etc.), but these are public spaces we're talking about.  And if we're worried about that, limit the government's use to finding criminals."
512,Considering all the closed store fronts in San Francisco you would think that the board of supervisors and police could at least help businesses maintain what inventory that isn?t being hauled away.
513,"I don't see a need for a right to privacy - out in public. You're out in public! Whether it's a police officer recognizing someone with a warrant, or an automated system is only a question of efficiency. 

It would be reasonable to choose not to maintain long term records, not to identify nor search people without a legitimate purpose. 

If our government goes evil - then this regulation won't stop anything, they'll ignore it. Pretendng like this protects you is nonsense."
514,"A well designed facial recognition system will include an ""ambiguity measure"": the probability that the result is mis-qualified. I've seen systems where the training sets have resulted in ambiguity of at, or around, P values (probability, or for the lay person, the ""chance"" of correct identification) of 50% percent.

One has to look at the purpose of facial recognition. If you are just trying to find photos of your friend, Bob, there is little downside. If it's used in  a criminal trial, then you want the technology to improve by orders of magnitude.The people developing AI, ML, NN are trying to do this, but it's not informed with a consciousness of the ethical issues, it's just finding a ""better algorithm""."
515,"Recently, I renewed my license plate certification online. The mail was slow in returning the required sticker to me - as a result, I was a few days late pasting the sticker on the plate.  But somehow, in that space of time, the State found it's way to my car, parked in front of my home, fast enough to slap a ticket for noncompliance on my windshield! It creeps me out that in a city where the murder rate continues to climb, our police are intently focused on chasing down such minor infractions as late compliance with a revenue-generating law.

This efficiency in what is essentially revenue collection, not a public safety issue, brought to us by the interoperability of monitoring platforms.  Expect more of it, as the machines get smarter and talk to one another, operated by dumb humans intent on saving a buck for Uncle Sam, Big Bro, or some other corporation. If crime that doesn't pay, don't worry - the cowed citizens surely will!"
516,"I?m especially annoyed by supporters of the technology who say that if you have nothing to hide or you?re not doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about. Coincidentally, it?s the Tech Industry consulting with the government who are defining what constitutes ?hiding? something  or what ?wrong? is. 
If you need a model for how things can go wrong, just look how we?re already being super-surveilled on the Internet. A particular putrid example is how Facebook scans photos of my friends and then scours the Internet looking for them elsewhere, connecting the dots and packaging the data to be stored until Big Brother needs to look for people ?hiding? things or doing something ?wrong?."
517,Crime is taking away our freedoms. So who is really the winner here if this technology is used?
518,"The SF police does not currently employ facial recognition - but guess which Big Tech already requires users to submit a photo of their face, DL, and birthdate if they should happen to lose their password or be ejected from the platform and wish to recover their account?  

Facebook, of course.

I do not trust any corporation farther than I can throw my shadow, but we are all, at this point, pretty much helpless to opt out of anything meaningfully and still work/function in 21st century world - brought to us by the nerds, courtesy of greed, irrespective of human nature, society, and our better judgement, surely a very endangered capacity, if there ever was one. 

It's surprising that a SF governing body is even attempting to engage the clutch on one little vehicle speeding us toward our demise, but good on them for trying! Unless of course, it's just a shot of calculated, no impact Chamber of Commerce PR..."
519,"Freedom of thought and democracy cannot co-exist with the inevitable justified paranoia that grows as abuses and technological intrusion and spying improve.

We are already self-censoring online like crazy and you are probably crazy if you do not.

Now add to that self censoring your movements and associations for fear of being identified.

Then add to the problem targeted mis-identification and falsification of image records made possible by DeepFake AI tech and where false accusations are backed up by video and AI ""evidence"" that can be created by any enemy.

We who work in the heart of the tech industry can see the contours of a nightmarish dystopia forming as we speak which is why SF needs to take the lead."
520,"Do away with fingerprinting too? And let?s stop those police cars that watch for traffic offenders. Oh, and let?s do away with license plates and Drivers licenses, too. And no more cameras protecting your house. If we really work at it, we can make it so easy for bank robbers, murders and escape convicts to remain at large, to continue pillaging us, that your privacy will be worthless. I simply do not understand why a person would want criminal to remain at large under the pretext that, ?For some reason, my privacy is more important than your safety.?"
521,"This is awesome. Right now, in China, the government is using facial recognition software to keir track of the movements of all of the members of an ethnic minority, the Uighurs, so that they cannot poorest against the oppression of their communities by the Chinese government. 
Right now, we have a president of the USA who is regularly promoting violence against minorities, protesters, political opponents, and the press. 

Benjamin Franklin said, ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" 
We have a president of the USA that is convinced that there are no limits to his power, advocating for political violence, regularly, while his base cheers. 
Thinking that giving someone like this the awesome power of factual recognition software will keep anyone safe is delusional, but it is certainly a threat to essential liberties. 
The world is made more dangerous by these technologies not less. 
""The right to be secure in your person...""  must include not using your face to track your location and your activities."
522,Let's not hamper the criminals. Heaven forbid!
523,"Too little, too late. The US Stasi is already in place."
524,Good.  I don't want to live in a surveillance society.  The bad outweighs the good.
525,"Remember the TV series ""Person Of Interest""? If you missed it, the premise is at the point of full implementation of a facial recognition technology in which everyone in the city is constantly observed by cameras with their images processed by algorithm. The information gathered is fed to screens watched by agents who attempt to perceive potential criminal activity and go out to try to prevent it. Much like the Cruise movie ""Minority Report"" also. I think San Francisco is right to slow this movement down to give us time to consider the negatives along with the positives."
526,"First, San Francisco is not ""the real and perceived headquarters for all things tech.""  Silicon Valley is.  

I have lived in the SF Bay Area, but not SF itself, my entire life.  I have worked in SF for the past 23 years.  SF has always been too full of itself, as this claim illustrates.

Second, this city needs to start worrying more about the people not committing crimes.  They don't even bother to investigate car break-ins or shoplifting.  Now they are denying police a tool that can help catch rapists and murderers.  There are many reasons I have never moved to SF; this attitude is one of them."
527,"Reminds me of the pointless Snowden scandal. The civil liberties crowd never presented a single instance of the government reading people's emails or otherwise damaging any innocent person through their massive automated surveillance operation.

So here's another example of a valuable tool we will not be using to fight crime and terrorism because, feelings."
528,"Robots and artificial intelligence:  how can we govern them?  Can they be ethical?  Should we tax them?

529,"""Seattle and California?s Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have all barred municipal police from deploying new surveillance technology without approval from the local government.""

Isn't one of the main benefits of this technology is that it can help monitor what local government is doing?"
530,"I've seen facial recognition compared to fingerprints. But, that is a grossly mistaken analogy. Fingerprints are taken when a person is arrested and are SUPPOSED to be destroyed if the person is not convicted, though this is rarely done in real life. They are taken for several other reasons - but always voluntarily. A bank or pawnshop may require a thumbprint- but you are under no obligation to use that bank or pawnshop & can refuse to give your prints. The military takes prints (primarily for identifying casualties), but you don't have to join the military. I had to give my fingerprints to the FBI when I got a security clearance to do a software contract for Homeland Security - but I could have accepted a different offer & not given them.

Facial recognition has no restrictions on it & profiles can be taken, encoded, & stored in massive databases of every single person in the country - without our knowledge or permission. Facial recognition is not as accurate (currently) as fingerprints & can produce false positive & negative results. It is also relatively easy to defeat by criminals who know how to disguise the contours of their faces with prostheses or even some cotton in cheeks & gums to change the relationship of the identifying markers. A database of facial recognition records is the ultimate in big-brother technology, capable of being used by governments for far more than just tracking criminals. Political dissidents can be tracked, for example."
531,Can we at least use  FR technology for our service dogs? I know my dog would feel better and sleep better with the extra security.
532,"I am amazed at the total trust in the corrupt criminal justice system expressed in this comments section. 1984 surveillance state is finally here and Yes - it needs to be regulated because as anyone who does not live with their head in the sand knows - all new supposedly miraculous forensic technology - be it finger printing, DNA and now facial recognition systems are not 100% foolproof methods are are prone to mistakes - that can ruin innocent people's lives. I just read that Google made a deal with NYC to use the new info/wifi kiosks everywhere that have several cameras inside recording NYC citizens 24/7 - for testing its new facial recognition system. Hmmm, I wonder what Google will do with this data - maybe sell it to the highest bidder? Europe is ahead of in right to privacy issues and real legislation and penalties for those creepy corporations and or Government institutions that disregard our hard earned rights and freedoms in pursuit of profits and control/power. Like Ben Franklin said ""Those willing to sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither"" 
WAKE UP SHEEPLE! Crime has been steadily going down for 40 years in NYC & nationally-way before all this camera surveillance was put into our cities/country! Do your research and don't believe the hype and live in false fear! Regulate & break up the surveillance and internet social media corporate monopolies NOW! Let's keep our cherished liberties in tact & make the free market truly free for all to pursue their dreams!"
533,"This technology will be a boon to find disability cheaters who claim injury yet do heavy work especially in civil service disabilities where there is fraud  and SSA.
I guess we have to live with this and 1984 should be re written in 2014."
534,"Really New York?  I won?t be visiting until you respect my civil rights by banning facial recognition tech. I grew up in LA, white, middle-class and under para-military LAPD.  The abuses this tech allows will definitely come to fruition.  More people will be killed by the abuse of this tech than might lose their lives without it.  STOP IT NOW."
535,"The Times is afraid of what, exactly, with facial recognition? SF might have been able to accurately identify who was pooping on the sidewalk at the corner of Turk and Hyde, but not now. Nope, the city government has turned it's back on technology because they don't want to admit that the great social experiment of tolerating urban camping and open drug dealing and use has transformed SF into a cesspit. Everyone who has has a job and a cell phone and a credit card is constantly tracked anyways. It's only those who live outside of society who would be affected by facial recognition; those who steal, those who deal drugs, those who defecate in the streets. SF crime rates are soaring. Please don't advocate dragging NYC back to the crime rates of the late 70's, just to grandstand about personal liberties that only help those who would do harm to themselves and others."
536,"Why would anyone not want this technology available

to help catch criminals ?

Do you live in a Gated Community and only 

go to the safest places ?"
537,"I totally support the police use of facial recognition technology. it will hopefully assist them in finding perpetrators of crimes. We see more and more criminals located in the city on account of the ubiquitous use of surveillance cameras. To me, it's all good. If you don't want to share information on yourself, abstain from using the grid or move someplace off the grid."
538,Facial recognition should be illegal without a court order.  Facebook and Twitter should be prohibited from selling information about anybody.  We must stop becoming a '1984' society.
539,"If you use a credit card that company has a ridiculous amount of info on you. 

If you use a cell phone, what the carrier knows about you is just the tip of the iceberg. 

The operating system providers (Google or Apple) know everything you do on the phone and everyplace you go. Just about the same applies to most of the app vendors for the apps you have on your phone. 

Got an EZPass in your car... they know something about your travel habits. 

What about travel and traffic telemetry your car provides to Sirius/XM even if you don't subscribe? 

What about vehicle information that some vehicles communicate back to the manufacturer?

What about all of the credit rating agencies? 

Lets not even begin to think about what FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest know about you... just in case you use any of those wastes of time. 

The point is that for most people, facial recognition, while intrusive, is nothing new. The data being collected on you is already enormous. 

I would be all for rolling a lot of the surveillance back, but lets not pretend that facial recognition is something new. We have been under surveillance by private firms and government for years."
540,"The use of this technology by local law enforcement is almost entirely positive.  The abuses come at the federal level, where there is the money and the incentive to create massive databases of faces and profiles, and engage in data-mining.  

It would be ironic if the area that benefits citizens was abandoned while the area that is actually of concern went on behind security-agency doors."
541,Question: What do normal law-abiding people have to fear from this technology?  Being falsely identified?  So what??
542,"I don't have a problem with it being used to track known felons at all.  Once someone has committed a violent crime -they ought to be in that database and show up everywhere they go.

I also don't have a problem with suspected felons with the approval of a warrant to ""follow"" - no different than having police ""follow"" physically.

We're never going to totally ban the technology - we need to regulate it like we would with anything that can be abused and when it IS abused - we need to not flinch in holding the violators accountable - and publically so that the public can have trust and confidence in it's use.

The technology itself is no different than actually having police and having rules for policing. 

The ""see no evil"" approach to it is in a word - dumb."
543,"If privacy no longer exists, perhaps it is time to take a look at the validity of our moral visions.  Moderates all end up being condemned by either the PC police or the fundamentalist right.  At our cores we are the ""third chimpanzee""."
544,"San Francisco is hardly a poster child from which NYC should emulate or gain progressive insight. 16,000 reports of feces on the streets and sidewalks in a one week period ought to flash a warning sign. Shameful. No wonder San Francisco outlawed facial recognition."
545,This kind of nonsense is why I'm not a liberal anymore.
546,NYC is controlled by a thuggish police force that has cultivated a brutish culture for generations. If they want facial recognition they will get it. Who's going to take them on?
547,"SF is the city where an illegal alien can be picked up, released by the city, go kill a citizen, and be found not guilty."
548,"Are you SURE you want to hold San Francisco up as an example to New York City? 

SF is a mess. The streets glitter with shattered auto glass from smash & grabs, just one type of property crime that plagues SF. Injection drug use is open, used syringes litter the street and that dog poop you stepped in is actually human feces. Teams of thieves swarm stores and take what they want. Tourists are frequently targeted. 

San Francisco should be at the forefront of using technology to help law enforcement address crime. Instead, its leaders are focused on hobbling the police."
549,"The problem is not so much the technology of facial recognition - particularly when it?s using cameras in the public space where it?s essentially a digitized version of see something say something.

The problem is the increased policing of speech and thought, where an impolitic comment can be cause for doxing and calls for loss of a job, etc."
550,"We lose our freedoms in the name of efficiencies and reduced crime. Politicians and the police are involved in a disinformation campaign to alter our belief system so we will buy into the need for 24/7 surveillance for our ""protection"".  Oligarchs, despots and tyrants engage in such behavior, and our kept in power by the police and prosecutors. Politicians and their media outlets divide us so we will not band together to challenge their oppressions of our rights. Governments do not grant rights. Our rights are inalienable beginning at birth. The state is the oppressor and the police are their enforcers. Just because we live in the USA, we are not immune to the oppressors."
551,"Yes, facial recognition technology can indeed be useful in solving crimes; it's hard to deny that it is a very effective tool, and losing it may have an impact on solving high level crimes.

Two points - first, not all crimes are on the same level.  I don't think most people really worry if it is used in a terrorist attack, a bombing, someone running over crowds in the street.  But technology creep exists in police departments too, and it can and will be used for everything else, however minor.  In order to do that, a vast database must be amassed and maintained.  The temptation to use or misuse it already exists, and history shows it WILL be misused to the detriment of our civill liberties. Which leads to the...

Second point - we know nothing about and have zero gurantee as to what really happens with the millions images stored in government data bases (and that is emphatically not the same as an ""evil"" corporation seeing me walk into Starbucks).  How long will it be kept, who can access it, for what purposes, with whom will it be shared, what policies and laws can be put in place to control/limit it all? Alas, history also shows us that odds are high the public will be lied to about these issues, with claims about the need for secrecy.

We need to make some careful choices moving forward, and we cannot afford to throw out even more of our freedoms from a police state.  Hopefully it's not too late already."
552,"I believe SF made a big mistake banning facial recognition technology.  I that privacy advocates are off base.  Those people would feel differently if a perpetrator, say a thief holding them up, was caught because of the use of facial recognition.

NYC is safer than it was.  Let's keep it that way."
553,Why isn't the internet considered a utility yet? It's nearly essential for daily life in the modern world and if it was classified as a utility the snooping would be slightly more justified.
554,"It?s important to remember that in many cases the public is trading their privacy for free or discounted services; From Facebook which provides their services for free, in return you give up the privacy of you and everyone you know to the purchase of an android phone where you get an undisclosed discount for providing some information, normally without your knowledge.
Personally I don?t use anything that is ?free?. I pay more for my Apple computer and phone and I don?t use social media. It costs more to have a less exposed digital life but I?m ok with that."
555,Ironic then that I choose to be a paying subscriber to NYT and use an adblocker - and get asked by the NYT to support them by allowing ads...
556,"One?s every move being watched is not open and honest. Mass surveillance may be beneficial in a handful of examples, but the flip side, that firehose of data falling into the wrong hands, is way too dangerous.  Some may argue whether or not the government are the right hands to begin with.

Take police body cams.  Sounds like a great idea. But who?s the custodian of that data feed?  The police having the final say on whether or not such a feed is disclosed dilutes its intention.

If these systems were by The People, for The People, and controlled by The People, perhaps an argument of ?openness? could be made.  However, currently, whether its owned by a government or commercial entity, there?s nothing open or honest about the systems being put in place."
557,"While we want to be connected with our friends, we are in fact hooked to internet firms. This dependency ( Alexa etc) works as remote control of the user. The process produces a person that is no more than an algorithm of internet firms. The needs of the human are satisfied only if he agrees to change his behaviour according to the economic interests of the firms. It is like second nature. Real interactions with other humans, purchases in proximity shops, personal initiative, creativity, individual freedom, these need to be abolished in order for this worldwide digital dictatorship to work. Look at all the people emotionally dependent on their gadgets and you know: we are doomed."
558,"I was recently checking my Google account settings and noticed Google now tracks (or apparently always has tracked) my airline travel and those of my family and friends as well as hotel info, car rental info. I was aghast to see Google trolling through my emails and Google maps queries to assemble these lists.  

I find it a huge invasion of privacy. I did not ask them to track this. They took it upon themselves. 

And even worse, they do not give you an opt out. 

Also, I have location tracking turned off on everything yet Google thinks I?m in the Czech Republic and I still get location targeted ads for the area I live.  It is completely frustrating to not be able to completely opt out of their tracking. 

In my book, this needs to change. Or maybe it?s time to retire my Gmail account."
559,"The reason the first instinct is that of feeling creepy re: being ticketed by facial recognition for something like jaywalking is because any system that supports TOTAL conformity denies the fundamental ambiguity necessary for actual living instead of what living looks like on paper - or in a computer code.  Even if that means a few criminals get away, for the GREATER good we must actively protect that fundamental need for free will, within reasonably perameters, and rely upon education and socializing the populace to live and behave as actively moral citizens.  This is why Democracy, (and perhaps Nordic socialism), with all it's flaws, is superior to Totalitarianism.  The flaws propel the mechanism of participation which allows for a superior life experience for the greatest number of people."
560,Does photo recognition technology know your bank balance?
561,"One advantage of being old is that I grew up with the concept of privacy, personal, and none-of-your-business.  When Facebook was available to me, I rejoiced because it meant I could stay in touch with my far flung family.  I enjoyed using it and added friend after friend until I realized I spent more time on Facebook than I did with my husband who was in the same room.

Then I saw myself as tagged in photos from other feeds.  I don't want that, so I took care of that by contacting the poster and withdrew into stealth mode.

I cut back, stopped responding to friend offers, and ended up with a very small feed and a lessening interest in the whole business.

I have a cell phone that stays home.  I find the home products like Alexa to be convenient but oh no.

I guess it's like wine:  you have to age into maturity."
562,"As a country, we've always traded valuable aspects of our society for convenience, especially if it saves money, starting with the Sears Roebuck Catalogue.  Continuing this trend, big box stores wiped out Main Streets all across the country, and those same big box stores now fight for their lives against Amazon and Ali Baba.

Privacy is something our young people will grow up knowing nothing about.  Millions of my fellow baby-boomers are throwing theirs away because they love the convenience of their gadgets.  Me, I've given up mine to buy CDs on Amazon and to make comments on threads here and for one or two other publications.  

I draw the line at a smartphone.  As long as they make flip-phones, I'm happy with that.  God, what a world we've made."
563,"Part of me likes the lack of privacy because I know that my true whereabouts can always be proven. Between credit cards, EZ-Pass, security cameras, cell phone tracking, etc., I?m not I?m nearly as worried about being falsely accused of something as I might have been 20 years ago.

On the other hand, I have no smart speakers in my house and won?t probably forever. (This includes not enabling Cortana on my computer.) I can?t imagine why anyone would voluntarily allow devices to hear what is going on in your household 24/7."
564,"The incredible irony of this so-called privacy project is that, The New York Times plants tracking cookies on your device. And that is for every single page of content. Now who's kidding who?"
565,"Not sure I will renew my NYT subscription next year.  I am able to keep Google at bay through most of my internet activity, but reading anything on this site fills my history with Google links even if I am extremely careful to not even mouse over any ads.  Then I have to clear my history and use the very annoying captcha app to log back in.  You care a lot about who is able to log into the account they have paid for, but care little about how you expose us to Google and your advertisers.

568,"Okay, that was interesting, enough of that for now ? off to browse Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter."
569,"I think we should fight hard for privacy.

The problem is that there are bad people in the world. Not just the government.  Bad people will seek to hurt others by distorting and misusing information about us.

Some of the worst effects of loss of privacy are experienced every day as women like myself are tracked, harassed and endangered by abusive men.

I avoid social media like the plague, restrict my location services, and block telephone numbers.  I wouldn?t dream of using something like Alexa.  I live with the constant anxiety of being found.  The fact that I simply cannot control other peoples? access to my private information, and that people think nothing of snapping a photo of me and posting it on the internet, makes me alternate between frustration and despair.

And now you want a government filled with bad people to endanger me further?  So you can claim some phony First Amendment right?  No thanks.

We need the right to classify our own information.  It should be as hard for someone to get my phone number as it is to get a FISA warrant."

571,"Call me old fashioned, but I used to believe that there once was a difference, albeit often subtle, between wanting to know and having to know.  That's as gone and soon forgotten as it will ever be again.  That's privacy, one-way privacy that works for others against you.  Call it 1984, call it Orwellian, call it deep state, call it whatever you will, your privacy is no longer yours, it's simply a tool that sells what you thought were your most intimate secrets to those who use it to manipulate your identity and your future at a price none of us can afford yet all of us must pay.

572,"All I can say is that I was surprisingly dismayed to discover that the NY Times had been tracking my own reading habits unbeknownst to me.  I don't have a Facebook acct or tweet so I'm not much of an online kind of person but I do receive the NYT newsletters and subscribe to the online edition, and I sometimes post comments.  I believe it was last year that I received an email with summary data on which columnists I read, what kinds of topics I gravitate too etc.  I did feel intruded upon and wondered what conclusions were being made about my personal tastes, interests etc.  The gist of the email, it seemed, suggested that I would be appreciative of the info but rest assured that I am fully aware of what articles I read thank you very much."
573,"Private individuals in America don?t have a history of controlling their personal information on their own.

This makes them vulnerable to snooping artificial intelligence and computers gathering personal information like FaceBook.

The solution is for all private individuals to learn simple techniques to preserve their privacy.

This can be achieved by taking a course on securing privacy online or at your local community college.

Capitalism is great for keeping us economically afloat but also a disaster at tempting companies to invade your privacy. 

Don?t let it happen!"
574,"What if Privacy has become a crazy distraction, like the Kardashians or the Royal Family? Shouldn't we cast a journlistic eye on usury instead?  Every year, we get letters from every bank we've ever dealt with saying they're following federal guidelines and telling us about their privacy policy. I would be more interested in an update on their usury policy. Some years ago, Sears was convicted of usury for charging more than 12%; now banks routinely charge 24%, with some banks going much higher than that.  Why isn't the times interested in that?"
575,"I'm old.  I don't use social media.  I am completely aghast at the disappearance of privacy from our lives.

When I talk about this, the young folks I know, nieces and nephews, look at me like I'm a martian that just landed.  They couldn't care less about privacy.  They don't think they're giving anything away at all.  Certainly nothing of any value.

I just hope I'm gone before SkyNet becomes sentient and takes over..."
576,"This stuff about ""privacy"" always makes me laugh. I am worried about other real things too, like herds of unicorns invading my yard, and the neighborhood being taken over by leprechauns..

I used to work in government intelligence back in the 1960s with a clearance about as high as you can get. It was clear to me at the time that, if anyone really wanted to know anything about you -- including what you whisper to your honey before you fall asleep at night -- they could know it, and find it out in ways that gave you no clue they were even watching. That was achievable by anyone with any average person's budget, with 1960s technology. 

Naturally, if an average citizen could have done that to you in the 1960s, think about where things would go in the fifty years thereafter. 

In the 80s, a LA TV news show ran a segment where they met random people coming out of a market. They asked one question ""Will you participate in an experiment?"" With no other information, they showed up later at the subject's home with a list of everyone in their family and each of their favorite foods, colors, music stars, and a lot more private info. That was in the 1980s before the web and big data.

The bottom line is that the ONLY reason you have ANY ""privacy"" at all is because your life is just too boring for anyone to bother to watch. Any part of your life that does matter to others -- like your purchases -- will be tracked by multiple companies.

This ship has sailed. Get used to it."
577,"""There is no explicit right to privacy in the Constitution."" 
 Ok. A better statement: ""There is an implied right to privacy in the Constitution, expressed through clear limits imposed on government in its relationship with citizens, including those of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, as well as several landmark Supreme Court rulings identifying and articulating the clear existence of such a right.""

 Let's stop thinking of privacy as something that exists on shaky ground. It's there. it's real. We have it.

 And don't forget many state constitutions provide greater privacy protections, or, er, more ""explicit"" protections for this right."

579,"You can?t govern machines that can teach themselves. And they will learn at an exponential rate. Without morals or ethics. Logically, the machines can find many reasons to terminate the human race. We?re destroying earth?s resources and climate for example. It?s a very dangerous and scary world to live in already. I can?t imagine the threat of AI on the human race. "
580,"With all respect, there is no evidence to support the claim that AI is only inaccurate in face recognition and crime prediction because ""..data is the problem.  The results were biased because the data that went into them was biased"".  

These bias problems have been known for years and there is still no fix.  More data will not fix the problem. This is because the problem is in the widely used deep learning and machine learning technologies - these widely used AI technologies are not that intelligent.

If you do not believe me, try to get your Google Android-based phone to answer a ""how to"" question the next time that you really need help.  "
581,"Whatever rules or limitations Western countries might try to impose on AI research or implementation will not be respected by hostile powers like China and Russia. Their AI research will not be bounded by any rules. So we must consider that if we limit ourselves too much, we would likely be committing unilateral AI disarmament. We need to allow research to the fullest depth of AI capability in order not to put ourselves at a potentially serious military disadvantage to those countries."

583,"There are a large number of current University research grants for ""the hardening of machine learning"". Making it more difficult to ""hack"" ML. 

One term of art used is, adversarial machine learning. Its purpose is to allow rapid crafting and analysis of attacks and defense methods for machine learning models.

In all my systems and network projects since 1986, cyber security has always been the #1 or #2 design goal, but it was always gone to the bottom of my clients priorities because of high cost and the lack of perceived benefit. We are much further ahead on securing AI and ML technology than any US business is willing to pay for. "
584,"Need to read Nick Bostrom's SUPER INTELLIGENCE.  Just the thought process of programming 'morality', or even 'preserving humanity' in an AI arena is quite daunting.  Fortunately we are nowhere near the 'singularity' (Kurzweil predicted 2025 -- not going to happen).  If the General AI singularity ever does occur (replication of singular human consciousness in a machine), humanity will be eaten for lunch...  "
585,I make no claims as to profound understanding of AI potential but my information from various sources  as a layman seems to indicate the processes produce results in a somewhat mysterious way and those results are frequently better than humans can produce. Since they are mysterious why is there an assumption they can be safe and controllable by humans who have a consistent  history of creating terrible disasters like nuclear weapons and global warming and industrial destruction of the planet and an internet that is rife with a large variety of  innovative criminality? Why is it assumed that human control is effective in making it useful rather than disastrous?
586,"The impact of AI on our socioeconomic system is one of the immediate tsunamis that face our species - climate change being the other. AI itself is in a state of transition whose outcomes may ultimately prove to be threatening. The futurist Ray Kurzweil provides a scenario wherein ?evolution?  leads to a ?Singularity? in which ?technology? is indistinguishable from human intelligence and in fact exceeds that of its organic masters. It is defined as a ?Superintelligence?. We have just begun to address the implications of such developments. While a number of experts have addressed these issues, Nick Bostrom has provided a framework in which the discussion should proceed (?Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies?). These depend broadly on three mechanisms: limit data acquisition; imbue the Superintelligence with ?worthwhile? objectives; maintain oversight. However, for each mechanism he also provides potential countermeasures by the Superintelligence with dystopian results for the species.  The possible emergence of such a ?machine? should also be a guide for our approaches to AI which, as it stands, is principally an ?imitative? technology at the moment.

587,"How?

the simplest way - pull the plug!

Simplistic as that, turn the machine off and that should stop it from doing things you do not want it to.

It is not a person, it has not 'rights'. So kill it and be done."
588,"The underlying issue with AI is that it is a black box. Data in, recommendations out. How one led to the other is opaque. 

The learning of the machine is based upon a ?reward? system, but whether the rewards are wisely weighed is uncertain.

Nothing much in the way of regulation can inform how such black boxes should be constructed.

However, much can be said about how carefully the recommendations are implemented. One item: humans should be in the loop."
589,"1. To be clear, at this point, policy or regulation would not apply to A.I. per se. It would apply to the people developing it. One part of policy should focus on how to hold those people responsible for whatever happens. 

2. If A.I. has as much potential as the experts say, for good or ill, we should be exposing it to ""data"" from the entire breadth and depth of human experience, and possibly other forms of experience. It should not be shackled to the narrow pragmatics of mere ""business and innovation."" Those are just the buzz words of the moment, from the perspective of some groups of people, in some countries. Instead, A.I.should be exposed to all the forces that make life worth living, to the tides of history, to the depth of compassion, to the sublime, to profound suffering, to the ethics and sentiments of death. 

If all you feed to the A.I. is the competitive tools of capitalism, you will predictably get an entity that can out compete anything on earth without remorse. 

3. Is it too early to start talking about rights for A.I. entities? That could be a way to establish the precedent of compassion for consciousness that we might want such entities to embrace. "
590,"Here's a simple recipe:
1.	Take a ton of data ? structured and unstructured
2.	Clean it, making sure obvious biases are removed
3.	Keep it aside as your initial training data set
4.	Review the algo and modify logic that might introduce biases
5.	Feed the training data from step 3 into the model and review the results
6.	If the results are showing unintended bias, modify the algo and incorporate more data to make the training set more balanced
7.	Repeat
The most important underlying need is to have a set of standards that define various types and degrees of bias. If I don?t know why/what/how much I have to fix, I?ll use varying degrees of subjectivity which is a problem.
The next most important thing is to introduce human intervention at key stages to review and correct biases.
"
591,"Why is nobody discussing  the near certainty that AI will either wipe out the human race, or change it beyond all recognition?  Gorillas encountered a more intelligent race, how well did that go for them?"
592,"""The results were biased because the data that went into them was biased-""
The most important comment in the article.
Why not an algo that checks for, and identifies, bias, of any type. Once identified, then the humans take over and discuss, adjust and then run through the bias algo again until the bias has been removed. Of course, there will be times when bias is wanted, e.g., a bias towards good weather over bad. 
All very complicated, like life."
593,"The first step to governing machines that can learn is simple - deny they exist.

So-called ""artificial intelligence"" isn't dangerous, but the simpleminded conceit of programmers that biological intelligence - including the set of values, of compassion, of responsibility (yes, that's part of it), of the infinitely-variable, ever-changing chemical interactions in the human brain can be condensed into simple binary format.

Non-biological learning is impossible - by definition - and as digital convenience aids (DCAs) become more sophisticated, drawing the distinction will become critical. That DCAs are already proving dangerous has never been more evident after the crash of Lion Air Flight JT610, when undertrained human pilots put their faith in an ""artifically intelligent"" anti-stall system that doomed both them and 187 other passengers who had entrusted their safety to them."
594,"""Garbage in, garbage out"" was a phrase I learned over 50 years ago when I first started to work with computer software. 

Neural networks (which is what most of AI is currently) ""learn"" the embedded racism and misogyny of our society when given data that is a reflection of hatred.

There are some rues that should be implemented curb the worst aspects of evolving AI.

1. The input to and goals of a neural network should be reviewed by a independent organization, similar to the Institutional Review Boards in place at universities. 

2. Neural networks should not be able to search the internet for data. Neural networks should be isolated in a variant of
Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) with no outside connections.

3. The output of a neural network should not be transmitted electronically through the internet. It should only be readable in a SCIF.

Will this reduce the utility of neural networks? Yes. It also prevents harm. 

Unfortunately, there will be some billionaire or corporation or nation who buys a ship, loads it up with computer and communication technology and will break all of those rules.

If climate change does not get us, the Singularity will."
595,"The extent to which we are able to harness the extraordinary potential of AI for the benefit of humanity will determine whether the decade of the 2020s will be the best in the history of humanity or the worst.

Right now we are on a trajectory for the latter, where the massive job destruction of AI and exponential growth in inequality it will fuel will be the tipping point to chaos on a global scale that will amplify current geopolitical tensions by orders of magnitude.

This scenario makes comparisons to the 1930s rather quaint.

Silicon Valley has failed us, rather spectacularly. It has already been ""iterating"" in re-architecting civilization, capitalism, and democracy, without the knowledge or consent of the rest of humanity. 

All to sell advertisements.

In doing so it made a mockery of ""listening to the voice of the customer"".

Either Silicon Valley and places like MIT execute the most consequential ""pivot"" in history, or history will be vicious in the judgement it renders."
596,"It seems that the expansion of Technology constantly
outpaces peoples' ability to see and deal with dangerous ramifications. As the AI machines 'learn' - and I don't care if it's how humans learn or not - perhaps they need to learn a system of ethics that will prevent them from making disastrous decisions. "
597,"Artificial Intelligence is a form of capitol investment.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Who owns it?  They're responsible.  ""Too big to fail"" doesn't apply.  But its not ""too smart to fail"" either.  And failures will happen.  "
598,"Surely, there should be a distinction here between teaching and doing.

A.I. recommending a conclusion and a course of action is a lot different from A.I. taking that course of action on its own."
599,"These machines aren't ""learning"" in the sense that you and I think.  They're collecting vast amounts of data, running statistical analysis on it, and spitting out ""answers"" that are just the most statistically probable outcomes.

What they learn, how they collect the data and where, and the list of possible outcomes is all controlled by human beings.  In other words, AI (even in the foreseeable future) that has been programmed to analyze traffic patterns will not suddenly learn about the varying levels of heat involved in the consumption of spicy foods unless we tell it to do so.

So when it's asked ""How do we govern machines,"" you don't...nor do you have to.  You use regular old laws that outline how society is to act, then you hold scientists to those laws."
600,"In the aviation industry, we say ""FAA rules are written in blood"" because many people died or suffered greatly in tragic aviation events that led to changes in aviation rules.

I am deeply concerned that the artificial intelligence industry is going down the same route.  Like drones and social media, it is way too much of an unregulated wild west in which many people will suffer as society learns to deal with them."
601,"The other challenge is how to collect data, either inert data like traffic data or active data that humans generate through their activities. Will I have the option to not allow others to use my data, i.e. Google, Amazon or Facebook for their own personal gain? Can I allow some of my data to be used or all of it? Can I receive compensation for my data? What if a company illegally uses my data. Can I sue them? What's the ""value"" of my data compared to someone in Kansas City Kansas? How do companies or organizations validate the data they receive? How data does an A.I. need in order to sustain itself and be effective? Just some thoughts."
602,"There is a very profound legal problem to be solved here: liability. When something goes wrong, who do you sue? Who ""pays""? That's the fundamental mechanism by which we try to compel ethical, moral, and inventive technical behavior in our society.

The few accidents involving self-driving vehicles have resulted in complex legal cases. Tesla and others claim ""the driver is ultimately responsible"", but there is ""shared liability"" (man and machine) in most cases. Accidents happen because ""systems"" fail. They are ""multi-factor"", i.e. designers and engineers can't anticipate every mode of use. Now comes along machines that learn, adapt, and change their behavior."

I found some interesting titles, aside from Wikipedia (which has its own problems), but almost all of them were only a hook-y headline, and for content one or two sentences of any kind of information. The rest of the articles were lots of reiterations of the limited content and the headline, written differently, but with no further information. 

I was amazed at the immense amount of filler that was spewed out to create what looked like a full article. I wondered how a human being could sit in front of a computer and devise so many versions of the same flimsy info.

While I myself am aching for a generational overturn in the Senate, I'm willing to give Hatch a pass on his language during that committee hearing.

*Of course* Hatch knew Facebook sold ads! *Of course* he and the other old coots on the panel were not just recently rendered aghast when they realized Facebook knows what hotel they stayed in the night before!

What Hatch was doing was to maneuver Zuckerberg into revealing, to a wide audience, what a smirking, vacuous, uneducated rube he is under his carefully curated hipster image. (Isn't he a little too old for that T-shirt by now?)

I was listening to news reports after that hearing, and all these urban sophisticates were tittering about the old people on the panel being so unhip. But as a result of that hearing, wider, wiser America became educated about the likes of Zuckerberg.

I'm far from a Hatch fan, but the joke is on the smirkers, the hip, the tweeters, the Instagrammers, the titterers.

Why don't you work on implementing a good regulation of our data first, AND THEN ask us to share our data? I'm already sick and tired of how my data are being stolen and exploited by the credit bureaus and silicon valley companies (FACEBOOK). 
Although I'm not a member of facebook or any of its subsidiary apps, for some reason, they have a data of myself constructed from my acquaitances. Don't you think there's something fundamentally wrong with this situation?


Work on to establish some sensible regulation that can protect the consumers if you want to work on our data.

Or else you are a just reckless mad scientist."
630,"I appreciate a researcher's perspective on the value and need for aggregate data.   

I fail to see adequate attention to the risks for patients/consumers if their data are leaked, hacked, sold/bartered/traded to profit-making  entities.   

At a time when access to basic health insurance is under threat from GOP legislators, this failure to attend to risk is lamentable.   What remedy do you propose when someone's  ""pre-existing condition"" is exposed?   

Or when someone's genetic material is given to a for-profit entity for their exploitation?"
631,I have been exposed to the uses of AI and to data sharing of health information data internally within Heath care settings and externally including with health insurers. There are real risks in the reductionism and biases incorporated in a great many AI algorithms. Even more alarming is the misuse of the shared data that is routinely practiced by health insurers.
632,I am more concerned with doctors not being to share my data than my data being available to data miners. The government should regulate health data so it is standardized and sharable between electronic systems. If vendors have to rewrite their code to comply so be it. My tax dollars would be better spent fixing these disparate data bases than funding research on my data.
633,"Health data was were put under strict privacy because insurers and employers are (were) allowed to use health issues to raise prices and deny employment.

641,"Longer, healthier lives are what's causing most of our problems.  Social security would not be in trouble except for that.  Highway deaths in Florida, ditto.  Medicare insolvency?  And the list goes on.  
We're mortal.  Accept that.  Let's die nobly, like elephants, without our privacy being invaded.  There's nothing to feared about death, but plenty to be wary about loss of privacy."
642,"I'm kind of surprised the Times published this article. It shows a real lack of understanding of health care and privacy issues. Most data breaches involve health care data. Plus, the type of medical app he is referring to would likely take decades to develop and to amass credible peer review science for before any health plan would cover it. Those are just one of many issues he raises that don't make sense. 

It feels like this guy had an idea to create an app using AI and was annoyed when other companies wouldn't share data (probably because he couldn't convince them he didn't have the right protections in place or a business model that would allow for ROI for their involvement). 

I'm sorry, but the editors of the Times should be more discerning of editorial content IMO."
643,The NYT articles on health care and innovation plus the responses they encourage from all over the world provide valuable information. It's not that one has to believe it all but it gives you a basis for asking intelligent question. An example was an article from 2017 which discussed the reporters' findings about dermatologist clinics in Florida and their seemingly excessive excisions.. It caused me to ask more questions about the diagnostic and treatment practices of my own clinic.
644,"Current datasharing facility has even without AI led to a crisis in science, because so many clinical trials and research results cannot be reproduced.   They may or may not be fake science, but often much money and work has been expended, and researchers  may have invested money in companies using the results.  Unless data is in a format that can be shared easily and checked cheaply, important results cannot be confirmed and should not be accepted.  Overconfident and biased researchers are reluctant to share, or make it difficult by mixing raw data with proprietary analytic software such as custom AI programs.  Reforming HIPAA would be a good idea, but not sufficient to fix datasharing problems.  Patients cannot control this process once data is anonymized even when access is audited."
645,"The author believes the problem is that developers don't have access to the data they want to drive a program.  I think the problem is that we have not put the control of data squarely in the hands of the patient.  Patients want to know who is using their data, who it is being shared with, who is profiting from their data and whether it is being used for their benefit.  They also want to make sure that it is not used to discriminate against them (insurers/employers) and that they and their communities are not stigmatized by misuse of data by others. Unthinkingly handing data over to someone without nailing down these fact is like handing someone a loaded gun--that may be used against you.  

Patients and the public need to understand and consent to data use in a truly volitional manner.  Contracts of adhesion--where there is no real choice (you want the service?  give me your data to use as I please)--are not choice.  Put the power to control data in the patients hands.  

They may elect to use a community data steward to ensure that their data is used properly.  In the Lyme community, which faces significant stigma, discrimination, and access to care issues--LymeDisease.org has launched a patient registry, MyLymeData. Our responsibility is to ensure that data is used for the benefit of the patient community."
646,"I am always intrigued by people who are opposed to something when it is abstract, theoretical, or benefits others, but then when it benefits them, they are suddenly wildly enthusiastic. What is that about?"
647,"The author is unaware of many of the efforts put forward by the Precision Medicine Initiative. 

One effort is the Sync for Science program that would let researchers have direct access to your medical records if you sign off on it. It hasn't been implanted by most EHR companies. Politicians are dragging their feet on requiring implementation. 

Another is the ""All of Us research program"". In a few years there will be 1 million people's curated medical records, genetics, and other information in one database for researchers to use."
648,"I saw a program on PBS how ""Smartphone"" got coined. It was done after extensive Market Research, just like the present phrase ""Climate Change"" was done after extensive market research instead of the previous a little too alarming phrase ""Global Warming"".  The catch phrase about Smartphone was ""See it is so smart, it knows everything about you""."
649,"My health data is currently shared with my healthcare insurance providers within the limitations set forth in HIPPA.  I don't care what good a researcher thinks they can do with my health data, I don't want access to my health data expanded beyond what is currently allowed under HIPPA.   If you want to do some real good for the health of society, go after the anti-vaxxers and legislate compulsory vaccination, to prevent disease that have been eradicated from being resurrected."
650,"There is potential in the uses Mr. Miner described. But I wasn't surprised to find that, while he used the word ""onerous"", he didn't once mention some other realities possible with sharing data in an environment where the party in control of White House, Senate and the Supreme Court love using ""onerous"" to attack things.

Algorithms that detect predisposition can be used by hospitals and insurers, large and small, for cost-cutting if it becomes legal.  Hospital consolidation is a real thing, and don't think it's happening to avoid cost-cutting - while financially rewarding those with the money.

Insurers are unable to ban coverage for pre-existing conditions today (thanks again, Obamacare!) but again, keep in mind that the party in charge of a lot of our current lawmaking apparatus have only failed to overturn the law because of incompetence and infighting.

AI that leads to increased recognition also imperils what could have been acceptable levels of anonymization, too.  So people signing up in good faith could find that technology makes them identifiable by inference after the datasets are worked, expanded and the algorithms discover new, unsuspected links.

So for people wanting to live a long, healthy life - eat right, exercise, get your checkups - and then push your elected and medical officials for rock-solid protections on medical data."
651,"As a researcher at a public university, all I know is that HIPAA and a host of other well-intended  regulations make it time consuming and expensive to do human subjects research. We must do more to insure the privacy of personal health information without making biomedical research any harder than it already is."
652,"Make sure that our data is actually safe from hackers (and that the hospitals that fail to keep it safe are actually punished in a meaningful way) and I'll bite. 

Until then, don't float me a line that it won't get skimmed or outright stolen. There have been no real punishments for the companies that allow our data to be stolen (Equifax, Allstate, Adobe, etc. I'm looking at you), and hospitals are notorious for shoddy network security protocols."
653,"I, too, didn't move to FIOS because I loved NY1. 
That is changing for me. 

Some of the new ""anchors"" and ""reporters"" have voices that can cut glass and can barely read from the teleprompter, let alone offer cogent, non-scripted analysis. They may look good, but those voices make me shut off the set. And what's with the sleeveless dresses, in any weather. I don't want arms; I want brains.

What is wrong with intelligent, real women. I am curious as to where this suit will go. My vote is with the plaintiffs."
654,"These 5 women have been part of my NY life for the past 20 years. I, for one, am ready to fight for them.  If Spectrum doesn?t step in and make things right, I?m switching to FIOS."
655,we younger women are with you every step of the way. we are more than our bodies.
656,"Ageism is a mostly unmentioned, unacknowledged cruelty. Every other ""ism"" has champions, voice, political presence. I more than congratulate these wonderful women on their lawsuit. I have watched them for years and assumed I'd be watching them for many more. Male anchors practically die on camera, don't they?They're not even put out to pasture. 

Nobody has anything against new and younger people. Some are quite brilliant and fresh to see as occasional talking heads. Nevertheless, it's impossible not to mention a predominance of truly insipid voices among younger women...the frequent baby voices that degrade the news."
657,"I love Pat Kiernan, but I have also really enjoyed reporting by each of these plaintiffs, and it saddens me that the Charter/Spectrum doesn't offer these women the same opportunities. I've noticed the changing mix of anchors, and how they've surrounded Pat Kiernan with three younger women now on the early morning weekday broadcasts. Kristen Shaughnessy used to routinely cover for Pat when he was on vacation, and never does now. I can't seem to find Roma's theater reviews anymore - they used to pop up frequently when I had NY1 on. 

I don't think they're just perceiving being pushed out. It seems, even from a viewer's point of view, that they have been pushed out."
658,"Let?s face it, young, pretty women have advantages.  They can get these jobs because they are young and pretty.  Young men, on the other hand, must wait until they are experienced and competent to get these jobs. 

This lawsuit is hypocritical.  Why didn't these women sue when they were young and pretty and got their jobs because they were young and pretty and not because they were experienced and competent?  How many men were passed over for these jobs because they were too young and inexperienced   The women used their youth and looks to get their jobs, and now that they no longer have their youth and looks, they feel they should keep their jobs?  If you live by the sword, you die by the sword."
659,"Charter's profiles of the Roma Torre and Pat Kiernan:

Roma Torre's, six paragraphs in, states, ""Roma headed back to New York City in 1992, where she is NY1's mid-day anchor.""  Somewhat confusing..not at all congratulatory. 

However, the male anchor's begins with, ""Pat Kiernan has been morning anchor at NY1 News since 1997."" 

We can tell whom they value in these bios."
660,"And NY1 destroyed their weekly theater show!  Donna Karger and her team was excellent.  Now they have that pretty boy giggling,  his
reviews are useless.

What a shame.   

And Sam Roberts?s Inside the NYT has moved to CUNY channel.

I no longer watch #1."
661,"If you're an employee, anyone's employee, you're not entitled to keep your job. Especially in media and entertainment which is subject to ratings and must keep changing to stay fresh, exciting and competitive. I think these women should pursue new opportunities in media at other companies while in their current jobs and start new ventures of their own on the web, print or broadcast. If noncompete clauses in their NY1 contracts prevent them from doing so, then that's the issue they should sue against."
662,"These women ARE correct!  I've been watching NY1 from the day it went on air.  Today with my smart TV, NY1 programmed to come on when I turn the TV on.  No more.  I won't watch NY1 again - ever unless NY1 gives up this litigation.  Maybe their ""old"" CEO should be replaced with a younger, say mid-30's/*early* 40's sexy looking man.  Wow, this is really disgusting &  believe every word from these women.  I hope I chosen if there's a jury, & I will listen to both sides.  Btw, as a Manhattan resident for all my life, I really miss Ms. Torre's Broadway show since I go to the theater regularly.  Ugh, disgusting!"
663,"This is disgraceful.  I love Roma and Kristen and the hard working women on NY1 who bring their warmth and intelligence which is something special to be acknowledged celebrated and promoted.  Shame on Charter,  they sound just as bad as NBC who dumped the beloved Sue Simmons a few years back and kept her older male counterpart. Shame on all of them. #EqualPay4EqualWork"
664,"You go ladies! And someone please get rid of those hideous Sex and the City wannabe dresses on NY1.  This is NY, not Texas."
665,"Wait, don't younger women go after older men, can we sue.  Get another job ladies.  No one owes you anything.  Too many lawyers, too much time on their hands.  Once, I had a job I did not like-so I quit.  How weird. Whatever."
666,"We can't even get our lawmakers to agree that woman should be paid equal to what men earn for the same job, are we surprised that primarily women ""age out"" of television jobs while their male counterparts just become sages?   Charter Communications may think they know television, they don't know New York City jurors, do they?"
667,"This is clearly the case in on-air television broadcasting. Women are aged out; men become ""distinguished elders of broadcasting."" Here where I live, women who gain even an ounce of weight are sent to a fat farm to lose weight, while men (one in particular I could name but won't) can gain all the weight they want because of their ""journalism prowess."" I have been in radio broadcasting for 40-plus years on a part-time basis. I also worked a full-time job elsewhere. My ""day"" job was eliminated when I was 59, and I faced age discrimination when looking for another job at that time. I was down to my last two weeks' worth of unemployment insurance and had no idea what I would do. I then paid for my own background check and fingerprints and signed up to become a substitute teacher. Fortunately, I did find something, from which I retired a couple of years ago. When I did find work at age 59, the people who hired me (who were attorneys) asked me why I thought someone with my expertise and recommendations had had such a hard time finding a job. I want to blurt out, ""AGE DISCRIMINATION,"" but said my theory was that perhaps my salary requirements might have been too high. They responded that they felt my salary requirements were quite modest, so I let them put two and two together. At a time when so many jobs are going unfilled, we need to look at the talent of older workers being wasted b/c of age discrimination."
668,"Charter Communications is treating its viewers like idiots.  These broadcast journalists are talented and charismatic.  Unlike other commenters, I enjoy the morning banter among the four NY1 personalities.  I watch the PBS News Hour and listen to WNYC for the bulk of my news.  I watch Mornings on 1 for the weather, for some news of local interest and for the personalities.  Each of the six anchorpersons who are plaintiffs in this lawsuit have made NY! a better channel, regardless of their gender.  They deserved better.  My only fear is that when the case progresses, mud will be slung and some of that mud will be slung at them."
669,"Things like this happen when someone behind a desk, who is probably not from NY, and who has never watched NY1, decides that the programming needs to be ""updated"". They have completely overlooked the comfort that is provided by something that hasn't changed. That you could put on NY1, get ready for work and prepare yourself for the sensory onslaught that is NY."
670,"I had a feeling this was happening based on how much things were slowly changing since the acquisition. I found myself saying.. wait where is so-and-so... why aren't they on camera anymore or as much.

NY1 was literally the only reason we didn't move to FIOS when they were beating down our door after wiring our building up and offering higher tier services for less money.

Might have to reassess that after we see what happens here, not a good look at all."
671,News producers seem to assume that watching middle aged female news anchors would somehow be intolerable to the folks at home. Give your audience a little credit. We are not that shallow.
672,The Times should report whether The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits a TV station from hiring a person who is willing to accept a lower salary and to layoff (or in this case reassign) a higher cost employee.
673,"?We take these allegations seriously, and as we complete our thorough review, we have not found any merit to them,? Ms. Huff said in a statement. ?NY1 is a respectful and fair workplace, and we?re committed to providing a work environment in which all our employees are valued and empowered.?

All corporate speak. Let's go team!!!! Except for you and you and you."
674,"The sooner men are forced out of executive positions the better, and if a company needs to retain a law firm to defend itself against charges of workplace sexism, you might as well just admit that you have bad management. I admire these women for taking on the company, but if I were advising them on their careers, I'd tell them to be always looking for other opportunities even when you're riding high."
675,I see this suit by the women as an insurance policy.  They do not want to lose their high salaries.  Now it will be much more difficult to cut their salaries or remove them.  One exception seems to be Roma Torre who has genuine animus toward  Pat Kiernan.
676,P.S. This is the last straw from Charter/Spectrum.  Time to change over to Fios.  Thank you NY Times for reporting!
677,I watched NY1 and used to wonder what happen to Kristen Shaughnessy. I assumed that she reduced her air time because of personal reasons. I support the women. The idea that women in their 40's and up are to disappear from society is ridiculous. I hope more women would boycott or sue companies that practice age discrimination.  I stop going to Sephora because of the way their staff ignore older customers.
678,"I had the opposite experience recently. On a flight, I called my hotel to request a late check-in. When I finished, the gentleman beside me asked, ""Are you the Veteran, or the spouse?""  
""The Veteran, a Navy Nurse,"" I replied. 
He grinned at me and said, ""you mentioned your USAA VISA card on the call."" 
He was also a Veteran, and we had a nice chat."
679,"My Father was the leader of his American Legion Post so my husband and I, both Veterans, decided to join it in support of him. My husband received a welcome package and I received a invitation to join the Auxiliary, which comprises the spouses of the AL members. They do good work and I respect the organization but I am a Veteran. I felt that my military service was deemed less valuable than my husband?s."
680,"""I constantly mistake that people will know my mother is a veteran, not a spouse."" A more honest, real and less negative headline."
681,"Until JFK in 1960, the Democrat candidate for president was ultimately selected by a bunch of power brokers sitting in a smoke filled room at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago.  Maybe we should revisit that system with inclusive power brokers who don't smoke.

Why does Iowa, a caucus state, count at all? Its very low minority population certainly doesn't represent most of America and yet, we are told, there are only three tickets out of Iowa!"
682,"Being a Democrat, I would vote for a dead dog over Trump in 2020. 
Being a realist, I must admit that the field of Democrat candidates will probably not garner much votes from Trump voters who would like someone else. And there is not much to inspire Independents to vote Democratic.
I believe that the good potential Democrat candidates are sitting this one out. Just like many potential Republican candidates did in 2008. 
Unless the economy goes bad or there is some October Surprise (maybe in the form of some undeniable and infallible proof of Trump's corruption), I fear Trump will have a second term.
The only person who may have a chance to defeat Trump is probably Bloomberg. He is a Democrat, he is rich, he may be able to unit Democrats, and best of all he's not Trump.
But on the other hand maybe I dislike Trump so much that I will grasp and any lifeline thrown out. 
I am getting nothing from the other candidates."
683,"nickgregor, 
You have voiced my opinion exactly except that I will not vote for Bloomberg either, this former Democrat will, for the first time in my life, swallow hard and vote Republican ticket.
Other than perhaps some gains in environmental controls that would be great with Democrats, I must consider the immigration pitfalls of voting for the looney left, so I am with the erratic Trump, instead."
684,Great choice for a running mate.
685,"?Four white front-runners, three of them 70 or older. What is this primary telling us??

So what?  Trump is over 70. Doesn't seem to be a liability for him."
686,Best column on the race I have read in quite a while.  Thank you.
687,"She has zero charisma. Nobody cares what professional pundits think or care about. The public will decide. As for Cory Booker, he should be happy he is a Senator and start doing his job. His performance as Mayor of Newark wasn?t particularly inspiring."
688,How could not include Andrew Yang in your analysis?  He is not white and he will be a final front runner.
689,"Frank waited until the last sentence to say ""she ain't got it."""
690,"Enough with identity politics, please."
691,"what people don't understand is most Democrats are truly afraid. Not afraid of losing an election, of losing this election. Biden may not be the prefect candidate but he hits the buttons. Black women understand this better than anyone [see Trevor Noah's excellent commentary on why Black Women stuck with the Virginia governor post blackface scandal]. We can hope for another Obama or a woman whose charisma would over shine the misogyny of much of the electorate, but in 2019 we don't have that. Whether Biden can win isn't a sure bet,  but I can tell you Warren, Sanders and Mayor Pete will lose. Heaven help us."
692,"I'm supporting Mike Bloomberg for President because he has done more than any other candidate to take action on gun violence and climate change, and he can defeat Trump.

Despite the outraged attacks on him from Mr. Blow of this paper and ""woke"" Twitter, I've noticed a very diverse group of people joining the grassroots Facebook groups for Mike. He has also received endorsements from multiple African-American mayors.

He saw the same mess described by Mr. Bruni and decided to step in. A hero, just when we needed one."
693,"Every one of the two dozen Democratic candidates will fail to win the nomination, except one, so there will be ""something wrong"" with each of them.

I was an early Harris supporter (starting from her victory speech in November 2016) but became distanced when more and more it struck me that she hadn't really thought through what it meant to be running for the nomination in 2020.  She was vague or contradictory on policy in a race when policy was unusually important.  She tried to be the one to recreate the Obama coalition without figuring out how to make herself a sustainable alternative to Biden, the other one trying to recreate that coalition.

I like and respect Harris.  I hope she continues to be a wonderful senator from my state.  And the vast majority of people who run for President don't succeed.  She's in worthy company."
694,"It should be a Bloomberg/ Tom Snyder ticket. And they should offer each voter $1,000 to vote for them. They will win in a landslide."
695,"I question the idea that a majority of Americans will vote for someone simply because they say ""I'm not Trump so trust me""."
696,"There is an old 'saying', that 'familiarity breeds contempt', and this may explain Bruni's observation that various subsets of the US population seem to be less than excited about a candidate from their group.  If you have observed the foibles characteristic of your group for many years, you unconsciously assume those foibles exist in such a candidate."
697,Harris is great just not great enough for now. She'd be a wonderful pick for AG. Let the best one win the primary and let the rest of this talented field help our country in the cabinet or other federal government roles.
698,"""For a party that celebrates diversity, pitches itself to underdogs and prides itself on being future-minded and youth-oriented""

What they may say is not what they are. The Democrats are the party of the DNC, the party of the establishment, of the ""deep state"" so revered in recent days, of invading Iraq and Syria, and war with Iran, of Neo Cons and renewing the cold war, of Russia phobia, of unchecked international interventions and unfettered free trade, of domestic surveillance and intolerance, That is the Democratic party."
699,"It is a hot mess and it's a shame. However, once the nominee is picked, I expect EVERY person who ran for the nomination to get behind him/her. I think Bernie's lukewarm support of Clinton really hurt in 2016. I think many of these candidates could have a position in the cabinet or in government somewhere - there is a great skillset among them - but they ALL need to be moving in the same direction. That is one thing repubs have going for them...they are in lockstep with their talking points and branding."
700,"Anyone could have volunteered to participate in the Democratic party primaries. Of the few that have, some have elicited more interest than others. No votes have yet been cast, yet. It's simply a democratic process playing out. Bruni's bafflement is baffling. If Bruni's unhappy with the Democratic party candidates, he should persuade someone he likes to enter the race. Eventually, it's the voters who will decide on the nominee. Hopefully, all progressives and patriots will wisely support the eventual nominee to remove the Russian puppet from the White House."
701,"Glad to hear Frank question conventional wisdom.  While there is lots to criticize about the process, much of what the media et al celebs say about it is always highly questionable.  Harris didn't survive, despite having tons of good will from this class."
702,"I disagree that the Media isn't at least partly responsible for this mess.  Very little attention has been paid to the issues or a range of moderate candidates.  There was almost no media follow up to the CNN ""debate"" on climate change -- probably the most important issue of our time.  I have several times written the Times asking for a comparison of Democratic positions on health care (maybe by a 1st rate economist, like Paul Krugman), and no response.  So, the media is contributing to an environment where voters have to figure out complex issues based on 75 second responses at the debates.  Maybe you all could try to do better?"
703,"Very simply, Frank, this primary shows the limits of social engineering by the media and the top of the DNC.   You used internet popularity, either in the form of name recognition polling or in the form of funding gathered from thousands of small donors, as a metric for deciding who to put in the debates, and pretended that fitting them on a stage was relevant to picking a president at all.

And the media picked the debate moderators, so we got zip zilch nada on foreign policy.  There were exactly two questions in four debates on foreign policy.  And the media got to judge the debates and pronounce the winners and losers.  And the media got to handicap candidates with hit pieces and loving cuddles beforehand.

And then came Trump's October Surprise going off early because he got caught.  Did it fail? No!  The media has been treating Joe Biden as terminally wounded ever since, and so they, not Brad Parscale, brought the crazy, cloud cuckoo land, Giuliani-Putin conspiracy theory through to completion to damage the Biden campaign.

Maybe all the ministrations over the field, including working overtime to eliminate people, and forcing people who had regional and not national recognition out of the campaign long before any elections took place wasn't such a great idea.

It isn't just the color or age of the outcome that isn't right.  More than half the candidates have no traditional experience for the job, and billionaires with none stay in no matter what.

Thank you, Press."
704,"""But given the choice of going left or going right, Harris too often seemed to be trying to choose both.""  Karen Tumulty, Washington Post, 3Dec2019)  To paraphrase Ricky Nelson's song ""Garden Party"":

""You can't please everyone,
You've got to be yourself."""
705,"I am a progressive Democrat, and I am fed up. 

Bumbling bozos. The Democratic party is inept and unable to function effectively in the hardball world of American politics. As a political party, their primary goals should be gaining control of both houses of Congress as well as the legislative bodies of the individual states. Conservative Republicans understand this and have been very effective in identifying and supporting strong candidates for office.

At this point, the Republicans control the US Senate. That means that Trump will not be convicted after an impeachment trial and Justice Ginsburg will be replaced by another conservative.  

Moreover, apart from its failure to gain control of the Senate, the Democratic party was unable to win the presidency after 8 years of Obama against a candidate as severely flawed as Trump. That is barely comprehensible. 

Finally, the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates makes the ""seven dwarfs"" of 1988 look like giants, even though one of them was, remarkably, Biden.

I am fortunate to be a sixty something, upper middle class white male. For the poor, soon to be poor, people of color, LGBTQ, women who want to terminate pregnancies, people living at or near sea level, people at risk for pollution related lung disease, and pretty much everyone who will be alive in 20 years, the future looks bleak."
706,"Are you serious?  There is no way that cutting the interest rate by .25 basis points is going to help those who need jobs, or are underpaid.  There are currently nearly as many vacant jobs as there are unemployed Americans.  The problem is the unemployed don't have the skills to fill the vacant jobs, or they can't pass a drug test.  Lowering the interest rate doesn't address that issue.  Also, there is zero evidence that lowering the interest rate will result in pay increases--NONE.  The NYT should be embarrassed to publish this kind of Trump propaganda."
707,There are no more ordinary working people than retired workers. And their proportion of the population is growing leaps and bounds. There is no way that these lower interest rates help them.
708,"The lack of critical thinking in this article is astounding. This move has nothing to do with everyday Americans everything to do with corporate and executive influence at the fed. this was absolutely the worst thing to do for the American economy. rates need to be at least 4 to 5% to have any sustainabilty, but sustainability is not something that anybody who is in power is concerned with anymore"
709,"If the time value of money is made to fluctuate, what economic benchmarks are there?"
710,"Not a great article, really. In any case, people should ponder as to why, with a historically low unemployment rate, the wages barely move, if at all."
711,"The difference between Trump's approach to our economy and the Fed's (up to now) approach lies in your words [ I quote]: ""...the Fed  . . . it's trying to serve the American people by keeping the economy healthy over time . .""   ""over time""---the importance of looking ahead.  Trump's approach is the approach of the infant who must have his needs met now.  Over time, we are creating problems for our own old age and our grandchildren's youth. Keep in mind that a higher federal funds rate is an insurance policy that can by cashed in by lowering the rate when the inevitable recession hits.  A tax cut is also a means of stimulating the economy when unemployment spikes upward.  Big cuts when they are not needed is wasting  weapons. And allowing the deficit to become fatter and fatter means that tax money will be used to pay interest on the debt ( a large part to foreigners) rather than to build schools and hospitals and help the American poor."
712,What a bunch of baloney.
713,"I haven't gotten past the first para yet, but I'm wondering - what, exactly, is an ""everyday American""? Are there ""every other day Americans""? ""Weekly Americans""? Perhaps the writer has put his finger on something - a ""once a year American"" - for instance. Anyone have an answer? Is it a class thing? Are the, egad, 1%ers NOT Americans everyday???"
714,"What is an ?everyday American?? Are there some that America only on alternate Tuesdays, and perhaps São Tomé the other times?"
715,"Helping the middle and working class, what a joke.  They really want us to believe that malarky?"

718,"oh please, this is all nonsense about wanting to help workers, the Fed simply gave into Trump's bullying to goose the stock market and maybe the economy before his re-election.  Of course they can't admit it, they have to make up a story to explain their capitulation.
As for inflation, anyone who rents or buys insurance, food, clothing, pays utilities, knows there is more than enough inflation.  Another thing that it seems they lie about.  And they might also note savers who are finally getting a little interest on savings will be hurt again.  They don't seem to count."
719,What balderdash!  The FED is working for and in consort with big banks and corporations who love free money.  Pride flags mean nothing if they had polices that abuse consumers and benefit the .00001%.
720,"What a crock this article is! I'm an ""everyday American,"" and this interest rate move does nothing for me! All it does is goose asset values and encourage irresponsible borrowing, while sticking it to those of us who are savers.

Here in the US, we have the lowest rates of homeownership in 25 years, despite many years of low mortgage rates. No one can compete with the all-cash-paying hedge funds who've scooped up all the homes so they can rent them to us at skyrocketing rates.

""Sustaining the expansion"" -- an expansion in which more than 90% of us do not participate -- has nothing to do with a ""focus on the economically disadvantaged."" It's all about getting the lunatic who appointed Powell to stop screaming at him.

To anyone who thinks their company is going to raise their wages as a result of this interest rate cut, I've got a condo in Trump Tower in Uruguay I'd like to sell them."
721,"""The wealthiest also benefit from the Fed?s decision, since rate cuts push up stock prices, creating big gains for investors.""

Hope the wealthiest are looking at the markets the last few days, Dow down over 250 today.  Cutting rates can help, but when you have a knee jerk President slapping additional tariffs any and everywhere, the markets do react. Negatively.

Not that I'm sympathetic to these folks.  They deserve what they get from this President."
722,"Cheap money (low interest rates) has the effect of inflating asset prices. Out of reach housing prices do not help working people, and helps cement the structural inequality that is killing our country."
723,"There were 8 rates cuts while Obama was President, with cuts occurring even while his economy was ?booming?.   Rates were held near zero until he left office.  Fed rate increases began only after Trump defeated Hillary."
724,"Window dressing. Rate cuts are pandering to Trump's demands which, as we know, benefit those with equity portfolios only - not the working people. Possibly working conditions are fairer for Fed employees."
725,"What nonsense is this? Rather than explain how the Fed caved in to political pressure - the kind one expects from developing countries - you?ve made this about a new responsiveness to ordinary American workers? Please, start again but this time with the dangers of politicizing all civil society institutions, especially those whose independence is vital to objective macroeconomic decision making."
726,"There are always soft reasons for a rate cut or deficit spending. It takes discipline on the other hand to hold firepower for when it?s needed.
Jerome Powell (premature rate cuts) and the House (allowing $1 trillion deficits in economic up-cycle) are both failing. We will pay for it dearly when the recession hits, companies are firing en masse but our collective pockets are empty."
727,Not sure how this will do squat for the worker displaced by family circumstances.  America STILL doesn?t care about women who have children or must manager care for an elderly parent.  We don?t even exist in any equation.
728,"The Fed was searching for excuses to lower the rates.  The statement is self serving, and not real

Wages for US workers are set by global competition, not the Fed rate.   They are , as they must under free trade move towards the global average,  down in the US, up in the 3rd world.

The Fed rate on the other hand, now that ZIRP and QE created a stupendous asset inflation,  does influence asset prices.  But instead of gently deflating the stock market bubble it blew, the Fed is further inflating it with its rate cut

Why would it do so ?   Economist have several explanations

Mr. Powell who serves his 4 yr term is caving in to Mr. Trump to ensure his re-appointment when his current term runs out ;  the Federal Reserve is aligning the dollar with the Euro and Yen, both lowering their exchange value via ultra low interest rates,  the Federal reserve is stuck in old monetary theories, according to which low rates lead to more factories build in the US - in reality it flows into stock buybacks and moving factories overseas - see Lordstown

Caring for worker is not one of them"
729,"As a boomer/senior I am sick and tired of earning next to nothing on my savings.  I remember before Wall Street took over everything we could earn 8 percent on our savings and geeze we were taught in grade school about daily compound interest.  What happened?  Wall Street happened giving us only the choice of Wall Street Banksters.  Pensions were put in banksters accounts.

732,"Well, is anyone really surprised? Capitalism is all about finding ways of making money & it seems inevitable that fear and guilt will become cash cows for people willing to appoint themselves ""experts"" in a field that didn't exist five years ago and appears to be scrambling to create some sort of standards.  How much the $25,000 and up per year actually helps folks other than those receiving the cash is perhaps open to question -except that it is not, because any questioning of D.E.I. (hmm.. Dei, Latin for God? I guess it beats DIE...) indicates instantly that you are part of the problem.  In this particular cultural moment these consultants are in the delightful position of being able to say ""Hmm, nice company you have there, would be a shame if..."""

735,"Seems like the goal is to convince every ?white person? that they harbor dark judgements about ?others.? I feel sorry for people who, if they simply had exposure to minorities, would figure it out for themselves, thank you."
736,"A pejorative story about white men feeling targeted by this grift is, although fabricated, nonetheless a ""powerful"" illustration of how bad white men are. Little wonder so ""many diversity and inclusion training in the past have failed.""

Although they haven't failed to line Bowser's pockets, which is what they are really designed to do."
737,"What about bias against parents? That is an all-encompassing group who is being completely ignored here - across gender, age, sexual orientation, class, veteran status, etc. The new nature of work being ""on and accessible"" 24/7 has without a doubt led to higher levels of stress and other mental health related issues - not to mention the growing inequality and poor administration of proper parental leave."
738,"Pardon me, but a note on journalistic integrity: an apocryphal story is one that is ""of doubtful authenticity but widely circulated,"" which means that Ms Bowser's quotes relying on the apocrypha as a moral premise are to that extent baseless and straw man. ""Apocryphal or not"" are the three most important words in the article and mean that it really isn't a ""powerful"" lesson of anything other than someone's imagination. Example: ""Whether you stole my car or not, the rumor that you did is a powerful example of how you are a car thief,"" is not valid reasoning or argumentation. If this industry is ""big business"" as stated, then why couldn't the author find one verifiable story to use from all of these consultants to illustrate the point more credibly? This is serious business and deserves to be treated that way."
739,Where?s the hard numbers that this helps? Has the retention rate improved at these firms? Has there been an increase in productivity? Discrimination and bias create unhealthy workplaces that makes employees want to leave or work less.
740,"As an industrial/organizational psychologist engaged in countless training and cultural transformation initiatives over the years, I can tell you one dirty secret these ?consultants? don?t ever discuss with their clients is the research showing how many of these well-meaning initiatives and programs actually result in an increase in racial, ethnic, or gender animus within the sponsoring organization.

If there ever was a sub-specialty filled with snake-oil salespeople, this is it."
741,"Interesting that even this article, while devoting heavy coverage to ?racism, sexism and misgendering,? mostly ignores the elephant in the diversity room: age discrimination. (No, a one-word mention four paragraphs from the end doesn't cut it.)  I can assure you through personal experience that age bias, both unconscious and blatantly deliberate, is not only tolerated throughout Corporate America but actively practiced, rewarded, and enjoyed."

745,"See, this is the value of having a marketplace.  How else are we going to get such innovations to bring to bear without a privatized insurance industry.  Another reason not to pursue medicare for all."
746,So you have your teenagers  wear the Fitbit instead? Will the insurance company know?
747,"I am so happy to be covered by Medicare and Kaiser and not deal with any insurance companies and/or pharmacies, it's a pure joy and takes the stress out of medical coverage."
748,"On the flip side:
Individuals should focus more on preventing illness and disease instead of just treating it after it happens. Poor diet, overeating, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, hard drug usage, sedentary lifestyle, obesity are largely within individual control. Doctors can advise but not dictate healthy lifestyle. I see no problem with using lifestyle data as a factor in health insurance premiums."

The real question is why so many able-bodied people choose a life of slothfulness and gluttony over fitness. We only get one body and one life, and being fit is much easier than most people seem to think."
752,"Our healthcare industry should focus more on preventing disease and illness instead of simply treating it once it happens. 

If we actually had healthcare for everyone people would get things taken care of earlier instead of later (and many times too late)."
753,"Who determines what is healthy?

For this exampke, let's say that I bought a box of protein bars, and 2 cases of pre-workout drinks.

Healthy or no? 

Does your opinion change when I tell you that the protien bars are comparable in sugar content to candy bars? Or that the pre-workout drinks have a huge disclaimer about getting pre approved by a doctor before consuming? 

What about if I tell you that I went to a registered dietitian who recommended both of them for rapid muscle gain?

What if that dietitian is known to be a quack? What if I was gaining muscle to compete in MMA (or BJJ, or take your pick of dangerous sports)?

If people who can conceptualize abstract ideas and would think to ask follow up questions can't figure this stuff out, I doubt machines can.

Like the magic genie app, if a program gets stuck in an unrelated loop because of a confusing input it may never get back on track. 

Insurence companies will do it anyway of course. But it'll be relatively easy to game the system using cash and curating a fake social media presence."
754,"I live in Mexico now:
- No health insurance - it's cheaper to pay as you go here - AND - doctors spend time with you.   
- Had no cell phone until recently when my GF insisted she needs On_Demand_Contact.    I turned off the facial recognition and most alerts.  
- I go on FB once in a while to see if anyone who doesn't know I don't use it anymore has messaged me.    
- My 2012 Audi is a stick shift w no processing outside of bluetooth.

Oh and I exercise a lot - THAT'S my insurance premium.

You don't have to go to Mexico do do this - it's exactly how I lived in the states.   Health Care and well, everything, is a lot cheaper tho...."

756,"Basic principle of insurance is don't insure too many who actually need it, just like basic principle of banking is don't lend to too many who actually need it.  They aren't in it to help you.  And don't do genetic testing for fun I think it can be used against you even if they say they don't sell your data....maybe you check the wrong box once & your data is everywhere."

761,"Speeding up is a good way to avoid being hit by something, especially when slowing down means you will be hit.  But the insurance company has no clue,  and you speed,  and thats bad.   Eating certain foods could be bad???  but eating any food when no other food is available, is NEVER bad.  Soda has water in it!    Insurance company dont know the difference.    Finally,  The company cannot track its own employees, as thats illegal under employee /employer relationships,  so the company will always have a class of people that get away with anything.  well thats really bad!!!        
 SO NO to tracking  until everyone is tracked     (OH BTW speed by default is not bad, we ask for our communications to be quick and the internet to be fast.

766,"People shouldn't automatically accept machine learning as if the system has learned what we want it to or expect it to.  This isn't 100% based on the premise of neural networks or machine learning, it's based on the fact that implementation and rush to production means things will usually be rushed, exceptions won't be planned for, and unforeseen consequences will pop up.

Just recently, hackers could fool a Tesla's driving algorithms to steer into traffic with just three stickers on the road (in controlled conditions).  Similar tricks with stickers have been done in the past - showing that some car-driving systems could be fooled to thinking a STOP sign said the speed limit was 40.  The stickers don't confuse people.

Similar attacks on machine learning systems happen in all areas, and they take advantage of flaws in how sensors and algorithms ""see"" or use their analogs of our other senses.

Suddenly you realize you?re living in a den of spies, and you don?t know all the observers or their motives.  I see a remake of Orwell?s 1984 in the future."
768,"I've looked at some of the comments and it would seem that insurance companies are using questionable data to determine premiums and perhaps cause underserved problems in a person's life.

I'm particularly concerned about a device that measures the number of steps you take to determine your health.  I have Fitbit that tracks steps.  But it does not record the yoga I do or pilates.  These are 2 forms of exercise that are very beneficial.  I recently had hip replacement surgery.  My practicing these  added to my stability and ability to do certain things for myself.  I don't think an algorithm is an accurate predictor of a person's health."

How do all those centenarians in remote villages in Greece, Albania, Italy, Japan and elsewhere manage to do it without even a computer or cell phone?  How about common sense?

770,"Interestingly the NYT keeps removing my comment advising- eating less, eating more plant based diet etc and avoid these fad diets and psuedo half baked science articles that only confuse people more with no real scientific evidence behind them.

Yes Biome/ Gut flora plays important role - but most of the science is far behind and it is too early to come up with AI determining our diets. 

NYT is coming across almost like Trump & ironically fitting in ""Fake News"" category here.

If a comment has been posted and people are liking - why remove it ? Does NYT get money / sponsorship from food industry >"
771,"Once again, the New York Times publishes an incredibly irresponsible article about nutrition and health that only serves to confuse more people and perpetuate the myth that we really have no idea what people should be eating.

Why is a cardiologist with little or no training in nutrition who has abnormal gut bacteria and diet that has caused kidney stones along with a misplaced love of artificial intelligence allowed to hawk his latest book in the pages of the New York Times? We know what to eat: Fruits and vegetables and other foods derived from plants. Period.

The health benefits of a plant-based diet are well documented in numerous studies and several best-selling books, including the recent best-seller by Dr. Michael Greger, ""How Not To Die."""
772,"What's simplistic and naive is your belief in the magic of AI.  Sure, it can give you an answer, but how do you know it's right?  Especially if it's different for every person?

And you claim that ""an algorithm was built without the biases of scientists.""  Give me a break.  Scientists designed the experiment around these glucose spikes.  Such spikes ""are thought to be an indicator of diabetes risk, although we don?t know yet if avoiding them changes that risk.""  The algorithms are being trained on that assumption, which *might be wrong*.  How is a study that follows people for a few weeks supposed to give information on long term trends?

Data and knowledge are two very different things.  And all this stuff you are talking about is rapidly being commercialized.  I know of no other mechanism that creates bias in science more thoroughly than the smell of money."
773,"It is actually quite shameful for NYT to publish this pseudoscientific, medically unproven dietary advice. There?s a large epidemic of obesity and lifestyle related diseases in USA, now spreading to the Third World countries. Most of it has been unleashed by the Food industry and Nutrition industry that keeps breaking down foods to find ? magical? ingredients or compound so that they can be packaged and dished out to people touting their unproven benefits. 

Most of the time when food is broken down it only leads to more refinement and processing. This is heavily exploited by the food industry by repackaging ? optimal ? ingredients. 

Its is shameful to see articles like these  in NYT. Its Fake news and harmful to general population. I am a physician and have seen the havoc created by the food industry on public health over past two decades. 

If anything please try to educate people, not confuse and prime them for the next fad. 

Nutrition and Food science has not really helped people at large. 

Like Tobacco, Alcohol, and Nutrition supplement industries it preys on desperate people?s somewhat less than tenuous grasp of biology. Its role so far has been to find ? miracle compounds? , patent them and push them into food chain and market them heavily. 

Really disappointing part is that even basic common sense comments made by me were removed after good 20  responses."

He's had his microbiome analyzed repeatedly and discovered rapid changes in bacterial levels depending on his diet. Dr. Topol may find that, if he radically changes his diet, the algorithm's prescription for what he should eat would also change radically, since it's really the microbiome that's reacting."

781,"I've had diabetes for a few years.  With a dietitian's help I've gone off meds and down to a blood sugar number of 5.2. I adjusting  the diet plan I received, based on what the blood test results, I would take two hours after meals, showed.  I've always thought personalizing my diet using home blood sugar testing was a key to my success."
782,"I am certainly not going to go to that trouble and expense to be given a list of foods to eat that I don't like. I think I eat well as it is, and I will die someday, that's a given."
783,"As an expert in metabolism, the microbiome is very likely the determinant of metabolic response to food.  For a long time we looked at food as substrate that would be used as fuel by the cells of the body.  The closer truth is that food is a mixture of fuels for different bacteria in the gut.  The bacteria, in turn, would make products that would influence metabolic response as well as having inflammatory potential.  These products, including fatty acids of different lengths, are then absorbed into the body and trigger responses.  
So different possibilities of foods to eat based on the bacterial populations is an interesting idea.  It will likely evolve to include which subspecies are desirable and how to better cultivate them."
784,"We are born,  we live, we die. Eat what you want and take the consequences because generally it won't make much difference. Constant monitoring, constant guilt isn't really much fun."
785,"When we eat is proving to be as important as what we eat. As Mark Mattson at JHU and others have shown, consuming our calories during the day and giving our bodies a break from nutrition is an easy intervention that has huge implications for public health. This technique is variously referred to as ""intermittent fasting"" or ""metabolic switching"". Mobile apps such as the LIFE fasting tracker make it easy to adopt this practice along with those you care about. In general, our society is dying from over-nutrition."
786,"A.I and algorithm is another concept which most people do not understand. At this stage it is being made vogue buzzword and  used to target and find 'more customers' . While there is no doubt it may have some utility in research- it is also more and more used by Google, FB, AWS, retail industry and now the ""Food or Nutrition"" industry to find and target more customers to generate more profit.

The goal is to make money.

Using buzzwords like A.I and algorithms to generate more interest to find next large of swath of buyers for the next blockbuster product which will  change your Biome for good. Whether it changes the Biome for good or or not- it will definitely positively change pocketbooks of charlatans disguising as scientists and selling meaningless nutrition advice, supplements and stuff.

Hopeless article."
787,"Dr. Topol seems quite enthusiastic to learn that our gut microbiome appears to play a larger role than the foods we ingest in determining our blood sugar response after meals.  But why is this blood sugar response the chosen outcome measure?  I suspect because it was accessible and plausibly linked to development of diabetes.  But if we want to know how to extend our healthy lives, the experiment will need to take place over decades and assess many additional health metrics.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue eating mostly home-prepared foods, fruits and vegetables, and less animal products, which undoubtedly have negative impacts through greenhouse gas production and suffering by animals caged in factories."
788,"Even nutritionists, seem to be aware of basic facts regarding the history and science of nutrition. 

Starting about 1900, Great Britain sent out surveys to housewives in every town and village in the UK, asking them to detail exactly what they bought for food and what they served their families.  This survey continued until the 1980s, and so Britain has a highly detailed data based covering the entire population for a period of over eight decades.  They know exactly how much meat, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetable, fruits, flour were consumed throughout the land at any one time. 

Britain from 1900 on was principally a meat eating country.  Consumption of animal proteins were very high, vegetables rather low.  It Continued until 1939 when the war broke out, when it immediately did two things:  They slaughtered all the farm animals (because it was better to feed people than feed cows, chickens and lambs), and they instituted rationing.  

Rationing meant very little animal proteins could be eaten, but virtually unlimited vegetables, beans and legumes were allowed.  Since rationing didn't end until the mid-1950s, the population was essentially vegans.  Meat consumption slow crept up afterwards.

Recently, they decided to compare deaths due to heart disease and cancer.  Direct one on one correlation.  It was high until 1939, and then rates plummeted and stayed there.  It slowly crept up, mirroring meat consumption. Historians now say Britain was never so healthy as during rationing."
789,"Listen to your body and enjoy your foods, in moderation. That is all.  
Simple is the best."
790,"Get up and exercise at the same time everyday. Eat nothing before exercising. Measure your blood sugar. It will be higher than the normal level for healthy people. The liver has released extra sugar for the exercise. That is why physicians rely upon A1C measures to diagnose high blood sugars. 

These artificial intelligence programs reflect the understanding of what is known about how the body works plus random data whose relation to good health are unconfirmed. So it?s a mixture of good knowledge and curious correlations. Drawing conclusions under such circumstances is problematic. It can be wrong."
791,"Another wishful expression of the magic of artificial intelligence. All that data is presumed to involve the computer programs collecting data, comparing it to other data for significant correlations, then returning the most probable conclusions. It?s exactly the same kind of thinking that caused thousands of people to see Egyptian hieroglyphs as magical until a very smart Frenchman decided the writing system. People trying to find meaning without a clue as to what they are observing.

The key to intelligent judgment is not and has never been the forms of thought, it?s awareness. Mathematics can describe natural forces and processes but those representations are not equivalent to those forces. Algorithms are mathematical forms which follow well understood mathematically valid calculations to reach conclusions. Just like any other mathematical descriptions, they must be used by people who know what they are supposed to prove to be sound. The aware actor using the math can extend his/her knowledge. The mathematical operations never actually can know anything only react as data is submitted. 

The diet produced by a program must be the result of the semantic significance that it has been given to use. The fact that someone eats a variety of foods that produce carbohydrates and the blood sugar levels measured afterwards does and does not reflect cause and effect relationships. Blood sugar results from both recently ingested and stored sources. Just the input reveals little."
792,"The author says ""we know surprisingly little about food nutrition.""  That simply isn't true.  Yes, there is a lot of misinformation out there -- mostly from studies funded by special interest groups (such as the egg or meat industry).  But there is a huge body of knowledge out there, and we know specifically what diet works best for long healthy lives.

Without question the people who live the longest and healthiest are vegans, and vegetarians come in second.  Those with diets high in meats, fats and diary have low life spans, and their lives are loaded up with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and hypertension.  

Now, that doesn't mean that everyone who is vegan is healthy, or that meat eaters can't be healthy and live a long life.  Many do.  But there is plenty of data that supports a plant based diet is the way to go.  

Dr. Greger, an actual medical doctor who reads the many studies on diet and nutrition, publishes many of them on his website nutritionfacts.org.  Everything he says is fully backed up by dozens  of studies, and he is the author of the NY Times bestseller, How Not To Die.

I don't understand why this is so difficult.  The information is out there, and people who have severe arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes go on a plant based diet, their diseases not only stop, but actually reverse.  

Oh yeah, you have to pretty much give up meat, butter, eggs and cheese.  Americans would rather die than give that up."
793,"I disagree with the statement that evidence is lacking to determine what the healthiest diet for humans is.  All the evidence clearly points to a whole-food plant-based diet as the best.

However, even with zero evidence I would still keep my plant-based, mostly vegan diet, for these reasons:

1) Animal agriculture contributes between 13% and 18% of greenhouse gases.

2) Billions of animals are killed each year for human consumption, estimates vary but at least 70 billion globally.

The time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men.? - Dmitry Merezhkovsky, The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci, 1900

As it says in the article, ?Although the right to free speech is a valued ideal in America, it should not come before people?s safety.? I 100 percent agree and believe that the countries safety should come first before anything else. Also in the article that this policy could sway an election. This is very true. If this was a policy it would make politics much more simpler. Although some people disagree with this and believe that freedom of speech is more important than if the facts are true.

Secondly, it lumps all programmers together as ""coders"", which is actually a term used in the industry to describe lower-level workers, not program designers.  Third, it asserts with no evidence that women would produce different programs.   Probably the most influential program written by a woman ( Grace Hopper) was the COBOL Compiler used to write business software.   Can the author point out anything in the program that is different due to female authorship?"
798,"All this talk about Silicon Valley, and not a word about Bell Labs, where much of the programming technology and culture was actually developed?"
799,?confoundingly mathematical?? Why are adult Americans so stupid when it comes to math?
800,"What I notice is that almost all the applications on my phone and computer are just works in progress - being updated maybe weekly.  And generally not adding more functionality  or improving the interface etc.  I infer updates are mostly fixing bugs.  Which should have, could have, been foreseen.  If this  approach of releasing inadequately tested software  is seeping into to say airplane control systems then that is a serious problem....."
801,"In America, racism toward whites and sexism toward men is now deemed not only acceptable but also required. 

""The mostly white men who built the tools of social networks did not recognize the danger of harassment, and so the things they built became conduits for it."""
802,"A lot of the comments capture a key point that is missing from the article. Coding is more like a language than a skill per se. Anyone can learn to code, just as anyone can learn French.

The difference between the best coders and the rest is not that they use different code, but that they create things with code that others cannot create.

Anyone can learn French, but most people cannot write novels like Camus, no matter how well they speak French.

Once you view it from this perspective, you see the absence of women in coding in a different light.

Firstly, you realise that there is absolutely no sense in which women should be less or more capable of coding well.

Secondly, you realise that what you probably have is a barrier which is not much different to what you'd have if the entire work of coding were performed in French. We would have a world in which kids who studied French in high-school often went on to become coders, while those who studied Spanish rarely did.

In the case of coding, if every girl in high-school had to take a one-semester python coding course, the biggest obstacle would be eliminated. They would immediately realise that coding is neither mysterious or impossible - it's just a way to encode and execute ideas, and it's as good or bad as the ideas. There would still be some cultural problems that the first women in a male-dominated field would have to face, but those could quickly be overcome.

Identical logic applies to getting more minority coders."
803,"I've been coding for 15 years. Some in Palo Alto. Some in San Francisco. I've taught new programmers for years as well, in the classroom. College kids, english majors, high school grads, and 40 folks looking for a career change. Also interviewed hundreds of developers and hired a small subset of those. This article (and book) seems to be pretty inaccurate.

Firstly, it is quite hard to learn to code well. Even in a bootcamp that teaches just the basics (not enough to even get you through a Google phone screen) the failure rate is very high. In Computer Engineering degree programs at universities, the failure rate can be up to 50%. I don't think coal miners can't learn to code, but it takes a specific aptitude and a good bit of math (which a lot of people apparently hate). You could blame the teaching methods, but it doesn't seem like we have figured out any better ones.

Secondly, the narrative that white males (I'm not one) have blind spots that led to their products being abused and would have been saved by women or POC is just an unverifiable counterfactual. Humans can be mean to each other, yes. Online and off. It's not like nobody knew that. It's just that many in Silicon Valley aren't into authoritarian policing, and prefer decentralization. That includes the crypto devs your article lauds as heroes now (though I'm sure in a few years the NYT will publish a think piece about how irresponsible they were..).

I'm running into the comment limit, but that's a start."
804,"I can see that many developers chimed in to complain about the characterization of coding as something that anyone could do, or that coding is primarily syntax. As for myself, I've been in tech for over 30 years and was a CS major in the 80s, learning COBOL, PL/I, and BASIC, but over the years working with numerous scripting languages, and then progressing to using other languages and tools, VBA, SQL, VB.NET, C#, JavaScript, F#, R, Python, as well as numerous related IDEs.

That is one aspect, but behind that is lots of reading, often more articles than books, but covering design (UI/UX), patterns/architecture (GOF), algorithms, database design, best practices, management, social sciences, and operations (Deming to agile). All of this informs the decisions I make when building something for an employer.  Granted I am fairly bright, so would have acquired knowledge regardless, but to define coders as simply working with syntax is demeaning. Even people that are deficient in the broader sense of the world can be deeply knowledgeable in their respective domains."
805,"Although I've been a software developer for 15 years, and for longer alternating between a project manager, team lead, or analyst, mostly in finance, and now with a cancer center, I found it funny that you blame the people doing the coding for not seeing the harm it could cause. First, most scientific advancement has dark elements, and it is usually not the science but how it is used and sold by business people that is the problem. This leads to the second problem, in that it is not coding that is in itself problematic, but specifically how technology is harnessed to sell. It is normal and desirable to track users, to log actions, to collect telemetry, so as to monitor systems, respond to errors, and to develop new features, but that normal engineering practice has been used to surveil users for the purpose of selling. Blaming coders for this turn is like blaming them for the 90s internet bubble. As it is now, it is a rush for profits, not the technology, that is a problem. Many famous historical innovations were driven over the edge by corruption and wealth, not by the people involved in designing and building the systems, although we are so far along in commercialization that it is now part of many developers roles to further the business model."
806,"I'm one of the coders this article talks about. I work at a major software company in a ""in low-slung Palo Alto office park"". I'm white, I'm male, I came here from a major university.

In broad strokes, I think the criticisms here are very valid. I'll be picking up a copy of this book to read and mull over. But I do feel there are a few places where the conclusions are undercut by stereotypes that don't do justice to the real problems that our industry (and the rest of the world as a result) faces.

I don't personally know anyone who drinks soylent regularly. The idea of a 10X coder has been a well-worn joke among coders for at least as long as I've been in the industry, and it's common knowledge that a team, not any individual, is the only entity that can make a lasting meaningful distribution.

Lastly, and most importantly, I'd be *thrilled* if more coal miners, lawyers, truck drivers, doctors, politicians, and citizens knew how to code. I don't want to be part of the ""new Brahmins"" and I don't think most of my coworkers would either. Code is a tool, and it's nothing (or at least nothing good) without the perspectives from across society to shape how it's used.

Many of us came to this industry because we found a place that would accept us, and give us room to grow and experiment. It's a source of sorrow for me that the very community I valued wasn't available to so many other people who deserved it, in part because of what it was. I'll continue to try to do better."
807,"The world of coding has changed immensely in the last 10-15 years. I came up coding in Fortran for mostly batch oriented programs, then database development and applications(SQL, Coldfusionb). When I started the emphasis was on robust software that would always work as long as the hardware was functioning. That began to be frowned upon and seen as old-school. The younger coders would get freeware widgits and tape them together to get something that worked mostly, but not always. The widgets could have been from Russian malware that could create a backdoor to the system (yes, a government system). But saying anything about that just got head shaking responses from my (much younger) bosses. They were glad to be rid of me when I took an early retirement."
808,"?You think miners can?t figure out how to write JavaScript?? he writes. ?Think again.?

Completely and obliviously misses the point of writing software.
I bet I can teach the miners to write an english sentence - is Ms. Bowles worried about her job? 

Of course not - just as no half-decent coder is worried about a bootcamp english-major taking his job."
809,"So true!

The guys that built the milling machines that could be used to make the atomic bomb components: they should have known!

The chemist that published a new way to de-ionize a molecule: it can be used to make nerve gas!

And the endless battle between the hero and the crowd, going on since Chronos and the Titans - it's still relevant today!

---------------------------------------------
The article, and Clive Thompson, completely miss the problem of silicon valley as they seek to profit off tech resentment:

Software is ""eating the world"" because it facilitates economic disruption, whereby a company with different transaction-cost and scaling costs can displace an existing industry or create new ones.  The mix of innovation v. wealth-transfer is not important; what's important is that it is an investment decision.  

People allocate vast resources -- the largest shift in private resources in history -- without regard to social cost.  


And unlike software, which is more and more done in the open, this is done in a completely opaque environment, designed to conceal influence and avoid liability.  Even the workers in an San Jose biotech startup would have no idea they are making bioweapons technology for Saudi Arabia via Softbank funding.

Sorry, explain to me again: Why are we blaming the programmers?

Why blame Facebook and Google, still major-owned by their founders?

My guess: to hide the real villains."
810,"Coding does not equal designing. The real art of any system is the design, not the code. Most anyone can be taught to code, the rarer skill is the ability to create robust, scalable, maintainale, performant designs.

Sitting down and coding and designing on the fly is fun, is good for prototypes, can get a first gen product out quickly, but is NOT the way to create products.

Many first to market companies end up tossing out the the underlying code of this first products because it ends up being non-maintainable."
811,"This article grossly over simplifies and over generalizes. In my experience developers that write code that is difficult to understand are not embraced unless they are the only alternative available. They might be relied on for a short time in a small organization that doesn't have better coders around, but they quickly get pushed out when an organization scales and coders are hired that can write good, elegant code fast. They certainly aren't worshiped by other coders, elegant reusability and extensibility are valued far more than arcane functionality.

This idea that ""coding"" isn't as complex as these ""masters"" make it out to be is a common myth. High level languages like python and c# are easy to pick up on a basic level. But it takes a very long time to write code with well organized architecture that can be maintained and extended by a group of programmers over time. Only a dilettante thinks that a soylent drinking Dennis Nedry jerk is trying to keep all the women and miners out of the industry."
812,"As usual, the Times's commenting system has a bug.

If comments are listed with the ""Newest"" comments first, the oldest two comments are not displayed.

Thompson should trace this bug report to a fix by the Times's software developers. That would give him real insight into what software development involves.

Here are some interview questions Thompson could ask:

* Is the bug report complete enough to reproduce the problem?
* How do you keep track of your bug reports?
* How do you know whether the bug has been fixed?
* Did anyone else report the same bug -- or are they reporting a different bug?

And the reporter's favorite question: How do you feel about bug reports?"
813,"my problem with coders is the frustration and time it takes to learn how to use each new, revised, ""improved"" version of software.  this difficulty is probably out of the control of coders because their overly confident managers have given them equally confusing goals and instructions to be completed within limited time.  my point is the financial success of software billionaires (gates, etc) depends on millions of frustrated software users who do not get compensated for adapting to the latest version of ""improved"" software."
814,"Blame the code when blacks, as a group, get longer sentences than whites ? Well, we certainly can?t be blaming individual black behavior can we ?   Match white and black convicts based on prior convictions and I?ll bet the differences disappear or even reverse slightly.  The usual NYT fear of criticizing blacks for their behavior"
815,"The recent problems with Boeing software highlights two problems:  software is released without adequate testing and software developers expect their customers to find the flaws. 
 Where I last worked,  we managed by crisis whenever a customer threatened a lawsuit for our not providing quality software.  Strangely, Boeing was one of those customers."
816,"Interesting to see how outsiders perceive silicon valley:

1) Coal and mineral miners, by and large, will not become programmers and it is folly to pretend otherwise. Programmers more than anything else require exceptional critical thinking to be successful; this is not something that can be taught in a retraining coarse. 

2) There are fundamental differences between people who write and test software (""coders"") and the people who come up with the specification for what the software is to accomplish. 

Software specifications are where requirements and details of operations are determined; coders build software to implement the specification. 

Specifications are almost always driven by marketing and business people. This is why companies like Facebook have unethical and immoral platforms: the business people are optimizing profit just like they do in every other industry such as Pharmaceuticals (pharma bro, Purdue pharma, etc.), banking (pick your example), heavy industry (Boeing, BP) etc.

Don't beat up on the engineers or computer scientists simply because they are introverts. Many engineers are on the spectrum and it is offensive and discriminatory to pile on a whole group of people because of immutable personal characteristics. The offensiveness of this argument is vividly illustrated if the group ""engineer"" is replaced with a ""person of color"" and the ""anti-social"" characteristic was replaced with a racist stereotype."
817,"An article I read about coders a decade ago painted them as a rather self-centered group.  One interview segment went like this:

Interviewer:  How do you view yourself and your work in the context of the wider world?

Coder:   As I see it, there are two kinds of people in this world -- coders, and other people.

Interviewer:  And what do you think those other people do?

Coder:  They....eat food."
818,"Communication was an issue when I worked in a large software organization.  We could communicate on a project basis within a small group easily.  The bigger issue was when we were unable easily to disseminate throughout the corporation.  All of us were working on isolated portions of a single application, yet we had feuds wherein our management told us we were not supposed to interrupt the work of other groups.  In reality, the company believed it could force customers to buy new software by delaying or completely halting support of older software.  We also did not have a general distribution vehicle to help others with diagnosing and fixing common problems in the software."
819,"Of course, the coders (and more to the point, the venture capitalists who hire, fire, and own them) are remaking the world around their preferences. Each of us is increasingly embedded in a set of algorithms. Each of us is constantly interacting, directly or indirectly, whether by voice or other modality, with machines. Anyone who doesn't think this this is damaging our ability to relate to each other as humans is fooling themselves. 

We may be coming to the point where we view ourselves as indistinguishable from machines in most of the ways that matter -- and inferior to them where we still discern a difference. The truth or falsehood of such views will be secondary to their profound cultural and interpersonal implications."
820,"Very few 'coders' are able to debug their code at the level of single computer instructions.  In one instance, I had to 'single-step' the code to discover the error was caused by a 'bug' in the compiler, the tool that converts the higher-level code into its machine or assembly level instructions that the computer understands.  I reported the problem to the computer vendor that had supplied the compiler.  I could not wait for the vendor to provide a 'fix  so I had to find a 'workaround'.  I also had to write a memo to our services group, since they believed my 'fix'  resolved at least 2,000 other issues with the same symptom.    Work like mine was not simply 'coding'."
821,"I think coal miners can figure out how to write JavaScript. But not many coal miners can figure out how to compute the Navier-Stokes' equations fast enough to forecast the wind on the Bay. (Hint: JavaScript is probably the wrong tool.)

822,"This could be a definition example of 'thoughtless' and 'insensitive.'  Putting such violent images within sight of an elementary school is absolutely unacceptable. 
Reference to a movie or not, our country has too horrible a history   of brutal racism to try to cast lynching in a comic light.  This isn't something a person should be forced to recall, much less explain to a child.  

Legitimate question:  *How* does it merit losing her job?"
823,"Don't be so quick to judge. Yes, there are people who do not even think about race at all and that does not make them racist, and IMO makes them less so, not more.  A few years a hair salon opened on the UWS, named ""The Colorbar"".  I was kind of flabbergasted and also obliquely offended,  though as a Jewish I'm now considered almost white in much of America. I mentioned it to one of my few Black neighbors, an older gentleman who was ""not surprised"", said he'ed been dealing with stuff like that all his life, and he assumed it was on purpose. Well, it turned out the owners were from the Middle East and really had zero clue about what that word meant 50 years ago, and had no intention of offending anyone. They changed the name. Don't be so quick to judge."
824,"White people writ large are definitely not sensitive enough to the specific issues our African America neighbors face. I'm constantly embarrassed and angered at the vulgar dismissal of black citizens' concerns by other white people, not to mention my own oversights from time to time. I do wish however that social media didn't blow up situations like this one. When people righteously pile on like this it can really damage lives. This lady resigned from her job? If she had already apologized and taken the images down that seems like gratuitous punishment. She made a dumb mistake but she is a foreigner from another country with different historical visual references and clearly did not intend to hurt anyone. It's really good that deeper conversations were sparked but this lady seems like just as much a victim in this situation as anyone else. I'm not sure why her name needs to be published and she needs to field criticism beyond the neighborhood where this all happened."
825,"The protesters demanded that the ceramics coop where Ms. Rose worked ""get out of the neighborhood""?  This is mindless vigilantism, looking for someone to hang. You might even say ""lynch""."
826,Everyone knows what a noose means. Does this woman think that we are stupid?  No excuse at all.she needs her head examined and her heart and soul
827,"Am I understanding this article correctly?  The woman who displayed the figures in nooses made some apology on Facebook -- and that was it?  She wasn't involved in the later discussions?  That's great the art store folks had a frank discussion, but frank discussion is also needed with the perpetrator."
828,"While I was reading this article and the sadness and dismay felt by those who ""don't recognize my neighborhood anymore""--their stories of lost identity with all the gentrification--I couldn't help but think of rural manufacturing / blue collar folks who are losing their identities and sense of value, being replaced by multiple cultures in city jobs who don't understand the rural poor hardscrabble roots, their religion, or their culture. They feel de-valued, too.

I am not equating racism to rural evisceration. They are different, obviously. But both require us to have empathy and respect--and hard conversations. 

As a progressive Dem, I am deeply pained to consider the real possibility that we may keep Trump for 4 more years: there goes our democracy and any chance to slow climate catastrophe. But that is the reality if we ignore huge swaths of our population with real pain: from racism, gender discrimination, class warfare/neoliberal economics, various addictions, etc. This is not zero sum. This is about suffering caused by power/privilege imbalance. Like this article points out, a huge step is beginning the conversation as caring humans so we can begin to understand each other, build trust and credibility, and work together on solutions."
829,"This is was encouraging in our emerging ""cancel culture."

832,"A white supremacist woman who moves to Bed-Sty to a house across the street from the street from a predominantly black school?  Sorry, this just does not add up.

Ms. Rose obviously did make a mistake by displaying these drawings on her house.  She also took the right step, walked across the street to the school and sincerely apologized.  It is not clear why she made this mistake, but somehow, she does not strike me as a raging white supremacist who support lynchings.

The fact that the nonprofit ended up apologizing for something they were completely unrelated to is just bizarre - an example of political correctness going overboard.  

I understand that changes in this neighborhood have upended many things and that some of the issues, for example giving more opportunity to black-owned business, should have been handled better.  But I challenge all old Bed-Sty residents, regardless of their race and ethnic origin to give their honest opinion - do they prefer newly open businesses (even if most of them are owned by non-blacks) to rampant gang violence that this neighborhood was known for twenty years ago?"
833,"If we all had someone (or a couple or a family) from a different culture/race/lifestyle/gender ID/geography/socio-economic background over for dinner a couple of times each year much of this would disappear.  

Some of our guests or hosts would become friends, not merely acquaintances or colleagues, and we champion our friends, not find ourselves defending insensitive, racist choices."
834,"sad situation.  the specific decorations in the photo, well they are weird; and not traditional halloween gallows stuff - where skeletons and ghosts hanging from trees are commonplace, along with dismembered hands and skulls, and most of that has nothiing to do with ""lynching.""  a noose is not always that noose.  so now we need to ban the popular word game ""hangman"", and ban the popular show ""the handmaids tale"" where images of bodies hung by the neck were always on display, and ban any show that refers to someone hanging themselves, and ban studying the American West or European history where hanging was a common method of execution?  or should the conversation be a little bit more nuanced?  

the other part of this sad situation is the culture war.  as other comments point out, brooklyn didn't always have  ""black neighborhoods.""  once a generation it seems that some group pushes some other group out. nobody owns the neighborhood for long, and there is always a lot of resentment about change..."
835,"I'm surprised at the number of people who are horrified at the images because they were across from a school. Do you remember reading Hansel and Gretel as a child, with pictures of Hansel in a cage, being tested for the plumpness necessary to cook and eat him?  Bambi crying over his shot mother lying in the snow? The Little Match Girl freezing to death outside a wealthy family's well-lit window? Many cultures felt that introducing children to stories of death and human cruelty was a necessary part of growing up.  We used to, too.  I'm quite relieved that we don't do that so much any more -- but I really can't be outraged when I see an example of it!"
836,"Hanging from a noose is one of the creepiest horror movie staples around. The Revolutionary soldier-ghosts in the Sixth Sense, the nanny in the opening scene of 1976's Omen, and more recently the ""bent neck lady"" in the Haunting of Hill House. 

It also happens to be a horrible symbol of racism. 

I refuse to believe that this woman meant to depict the latter and it's ridiculous that she'd be castigated for not thinking through the possible consequences of her Halloween decor. If it opened up a dialog about race in a changing neighborhood, fine. But she didn't need to lose her job and have her reputation destroyed because she chose a classic trope as her Halloween theme. Ridiculous."
837,"The issues was raised with the homeowner, the problem was addressed and heartfelt apologies were spread far and wide. Why the further need for attack? Would it be wrong to compare this with ....a lynching?

I'm a Brooklynite, I grew up a handful of blocks from Ms. Rose's house and my aunt lived around the corner from her. I am also unable to afford the neighborhood I grew up in (i.e., gentrified out) and look back on the transplant-free days of the 80s and 90s as the good-old days. No one likes transplants, and transplants with money are the worst. I also remember this area as having such a ""rich"" culture that you would not want to drive through it at night, and would think twice before walking through it in the day.

I also remember universal condemnation of youths who chased blacks out of their ""multigenerational [Italian] neighborhood"". But I guess now visceral defense of your immutable ethnic enclave is back in style! Will a hipster Spike Lee arise to tell the story of the marginalized hipster-folk?"
838,"I absolutely agree that the word ""lynch"" and the depictions of lynching of Black people are horrifying. But hanging isn't always lynching - it precedes lynching as a part of our history, back to the Salem ""witches"" and before. 

In this case, the depicted characters are not Black, it was Halloween, and context is everything. I commend the woman for taking the display down, but don't believe she deserved what she got. 

I think the real issue here is the displacing of less wealthy Black families from Bed-Stuy. It's in the nature of New York neighborhoods to change hands (I lived in Italian Bensonhurst, when my Jewish landlady resented its transition from a Jewish enclave, and until it transitioned again to become nearly entirely Russian and Chinese). But our national worship of wealth and those who have it makes it hard to address the pain of gentrification.  I think that's the real racism -- and classism - that's at issue."
839,"Art Shack really got allot of attention over this, could it possibly be that the only bad publicity is no publicity ? Did anyone see the fundraising attempts? And now they are in the NYTimes. Mrs Rose is ever so sorry...but is she really?"
840,"To Annie Correal: Thanks for an enlightening and evocative article.

What struck me in reading your article was the realization that we see the same principles play out everyday in America and around the world. Whether it?s immigrants coming ?across the border? or people ?taking over the neighborhood?, fear of change by the established generation and unconscious assumptions (insensitivity) on the part of the newcomers inevitably create tensions. In New Jersey there were legal battles over the right of a burgeoning Korean community to put up non English storefront signage.

The ability of our nation to sustain a diverse and integrated multicultural society is being tested every day. The jury is still out.

With respect to Bed-Sty and the Bronx neighborhood where I grew up: wouldn?t it be fascinating if Ms Rose and the neighborhood association found it mutually appealing to construct a plaque on the property calling out its historical significance in the history of Black migration?"
841,Cancel culture at it's worst. Geez...it is getting out of control.
842,"Both of the Times' articles on this story are disgraceful. The story here is that a woman was harassed by an angry (dare I say) lynch mob on social media to the point she was forced to resign from her job. Go read the Facebook posts - even this didn't satisfy the hateful ""protestors.""

A reasonable person would not jump to the assumption the Halloween window display was a depiction or or even allusion to the lynching of African Americans. The hair is red and purple. The paper brown because it is recycled. Even so, the woman immediately apologized and took down the display, then went to the school and explained the mistake. But this did not satiate the hateful, grievance-seeking mob.

So what's the real story here? It's not, as the headline would suggest, that a mistake created a healthy discussion about race within the community. That isn't what happened. The story is of a woman harassed by a social media mob subscribing to an increasingly prevalent identity culture, one defined by self-righteousness and vindictiveness more than the desire to actually tackle social injustice."

845,"I don't know what horror movie inspired these figures.  But they do look like black children to me.  Ms. Rose chose to use brown craft paper to make them - why?  And why depict children hanging from nooses - right across the street from a school?!?

I don't see why it's too much to ask that someone THINK first and consider your neighbors.  

Apparently, too, gruesome Halloween decorations have become popular in recent years - with sometimes realistic figures hanging from nooses, or beheaded, or covered with blood.  There's something very sick about a society that celebrates horrific violence this way.

I'm glad that Ms. Rose took down the display and apologized - and that the community met peacefully to address not just this incident but the many wrought issues of gentrification."
846,"Since the movie Annabelle is described on IMDB as about  ""terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll,"" then I guess there were dolls in her windows with nooses, not people. ""Nothing needs reforming so much,"" as Mr. Twain pointed out, ""as other people's habits."""
847,"The real question is : do you understand the difference between a 'platform' and a 'market(place)'? 

Companies are abusing the concept of 'platform', when they are clearly operating private digital markets, and absolutely should be regulated as such.

For a country that believes it champions the concept of market economy and free markets, the USA is surprisingly oblivious to the fact that its tech industry exerts virtually complete monopoly power over its digital markets thanks to a near total regulatory void.

In simple terms : the internet provides the infrastructure for digital markets, and a website serves as a 'market-place' -- the digital equivalent of a physical road network connecting consumers with retail stores, shopping malls, etc. 

Unlike real-world spatial markets, the internet has no meaningful physical topography intervening between buyer and seller - create novel opportunities to monopolize that regulators thus far have failed to grasp.

The digital supply chain network of a large e-commerce company is, in fact, a digital market - connecting suppliers to consumers. 

Amazon is basically a digital Walmart - controlling its supply-chain with monopoly power, wiping out competitors with predatory pricing, selling its own branded products, all while claiming to be a shopping mall operator.

India recently cracked down on Amazon for precisely this type of abuse of market power. 

Digital markets of the future should reduce size and increase number of firms."
848,"Did we not do EXACTLY this when we de-regulated the phone company.  This led to our phone bills going from 30/month to 300/month and industry consolidation but it also created a body of knowledge and case law on how value added service can exist on a platform.  

Any lessons from that fiasco?"
849,"i'm judging from the manner of this article that the coming tech regulation will be long postponed, ardently watered down, and passed with a celebratory signing that will assure ""every american"" (AKA, those who can afford the technology) that their rights are protected.

rights are fine, but i'm more concerned about facts such as personal privacy, data security, data ownership, data usage limitations, security breach liability, and so on. ""consumer protection"" is handwaving until it is made specific. ""whether"" consumers have the right to access data stored about them is already answered: it's a right, all right, a right that is not now legally defined or enforced. 

where should regulators draw the line between platforms and services? why, where the platform ends and the service begins. here's a clue: shut down the platform, and see if you can still access the service.

true, humans can't parse algorithms. (just ask anyone who has tried to debug spaghetti code.) they can however audit the effects of the algorithms, in the same way banks can be audited on their loan portfolios or credit card practices. if malfeasance is found, we don't audit the bank procedures and culture to figure it out: we tell the bank to fix the problem -- or else. 

the real issue, regarding technology platforms and services and algorithms (oh my!), lies entirely in that ""or else."""
850,"It is amazing to me that Americans have become so ignorant about the true costs of anti-competitive bahavior.  Too many have swallowed the propaganda lines, « regulation bad », « deregulation good ».

Adam Smith put it very succinctly: ?if you put two businesspeople in a room, they?re gonna collude ?.  In my 40 years of business, mostly in tech, I?ve never seen one act that contradicts Mr. Smith.  Only, they have learned modern advertising techniques, and call it something else like deregulation."
851,"Giving users access to the data stored about them came be meaningless. A user may be represented by a vector of 1000 floating point  values. Further, how these values are derived may not offer much of a clue as the the meaning of these numbers. For example, collaborative filtering algorithms, that correlate user behavior to other users, are by themselves, agnostic, and have no meaning associated with a particular component of the vector representing a user.

It seems to me, the best approach, as it was with TV, is to not engage with media that the individual feels is violating their values. For example, if you feel that Facebook is not respecting your privacy, delete your account. Amazon isn't the only marketplace on the internet."
852,"I don't have to use Apple Pay or Apple Music or ICloud etc (and don't even tho I have an iPhone).

We should have rules around data privacy, controlling fake news and anti-trust policies that hurt consumers when a company has a position in the market like Google does.

But we should be very cautious about going too far.  The Microsoft anti-trust case helped its competition and not consumers and with the rise of the phone and tablet (that are computers) no one believes Microsoft is a monopoly anymore.  Before that the same happened with IBM,  Warren't idea to break up the tech companies is naive, unrealistic and would hurt the key growth engine of our economy"
853,"Banning Amazon from selling its own products on its platform is nonsense, reeks of government overreach and would never be upheld in the courts. This is similar to saying that a mall developer should be forbidden from operating a clothing store to compete with Macy's.

Looking for a desired product on Amazon has become difficult. You have to contend with sponsored products, drop downs which default to ""featured products"" and Amazon Choice offerings which clutter search. But consumers can still easily search by price or average product rating. As long as these features are still available, Warren's plan is sheer overkill.

Finally, no one is asking consumers to buy on Amazon. It may be earth's biggest (and most convenient) store, but consumers have plenty of other online and brick and mortar options. 

It is best to keep government out of the way."
854,"I tend to like Warren ahead of other democrats because she actually has policy proposals (many). I also agree with reigning in tech companies and other behemoths. However, a non-political solution is always available. Consumers can stop being so cowed and childish. Don't use facebook. Stop using twitter. Don't use Amazon. Stop insisting the government do something when you can do something. Again, I am all for oversight on the tech giants, and regulations to assist in keeping competition more even, but if the majority of people in this country cannot control themselves enough to avoid being taken advantage of then we maybe should fail.

Companies that I have no idea why they even exist: Facebook, Twitter, Wells Fargo, and any of the various Koch brothers companies. If we are too dumb to not be made victims by oligarchs, then perhaps we deserve to be treated like dirty serfs."
855,"""When the private sector controls so much of our data, Americans should be able to know who has access to this data and how they use it.""

Wow. You just don't get it, do you?  The ability of the private sector to control data shouldn't be a given. No one should be able to control MY data without my express written consent. If this were the law, we wouldn't have to be concerned with ""who has access to this data and how they use it."""
856,"This is not how I understand Senator Warren's proposal at all, having just read about it.  I was thrilled to see this diligent public servant and presidential hopeful taking on the ""bigs"" of the tech sector.  Unlike many in Congress who look dumber than dumb when speaking with someone like Mark Zuckerbeerg at a hearing, Senator Warren has been doing her homework.  Hats off to her!"
857,"Is this a joke? Do you want voters to understand or do you want to randomly undermine Warren?

""Under her plan, Amazon Marketplace, for example, would not be permitted to sell AmazonBasics products, which competes with marketplace sellers.""

No. That is not her ""plan"". You have taken what little you know about a thorough approach to destructive tech (near) monopolies and emphasized one element out of context. Thanks.

Framing Warren's issue with Amazon's selling of its own products as about stymieing fledgling new companies ability to launch is off base and disingenuous.
She is precisely saying that Amazon's actual practice of using data from its customers  to shut-down/replace small businesses is what needs to be addressed. Amazon is not a ""new platform"" and nothing is difficult for them:  they very simply give their own copycat products a massive advantage via their algorithms by placing them first in a search.
BTW, we are talking candidates plans to regulate big tech and you are employing a make believe example of a small start up. 

There is no evidence that Warren's proposals are not more clever and complex- let's report more carefully on them!"
858,"Perhaps the regulations for companies using artificial intelligence (A.I.) should address accountability.

One of the (many) sticky problems associated with A.I. is the 'repeatability' of output data.  The term 'A.I.' only means that the software algorithm learns (adapts itself) over time.  However, that also means that it might not produce the same results two days in a row.  Most of us understand this phenomenon through the old adage 'hindsight is 20/20'.  That is to say, after we learn something new, we wish we had done things a little bit differently.

All of this means that there is no accountability when using A.I. software.  No way for an auditor to examine the data.  No way to detect if there was a system error or outright tampering with the data.  There are methods for resetting a system to some particular state in the past, but that requires that the entire state of the machine be stored, and then recovered at a later date.  That might not be made available by, say, a cloud computing company.

For example, if I ask a tax preparer to do my taxes using an A.I. system, and the I.R.S. audits me, there isn't any way that I could explain why the machine did the things it did.

Another example occurred to me the other day when I asked my banker why they credited my account $10.  They couldn't tell me why, and eventually conceded that it must have been a 'system error'.  In an A.I. system, it will be extraordinarily difficult to track down these kinds of system errors."
859,"I have degrees in law and economics.  Warren's ideas are not new, she is in favor of enforcing antitrust laws that have been on the books since the 1920s.    The 1920's was probably the last time that the average American understood the relationship between competition and prices and wages.    Now the poorly informed get their economics from Sebastian Gorka and  believe that anything bad for a business, any business, is bad for the country.   I support Warren's proposals to enforce antitrust laws to promote competition and efficient markets, but I doubt very much that she can explain her proposals to the average less-informed American. The people of 1920 knew that ""trust-busting"" was a good thing.   I agree with other commenters that a candidate cannot present as a professor and expect to win."
860,"An ?informed citizenry? - not just on tech regulation, but also the general state and direction of our economy, the environment, and our health care system - has never been more important if we are to leave future generations with the promise of America intact.  We should all be willing and able to accept this great responsibility, and I, for one, depend upon the free press to be as informed as I can."
861,"I'm surprised the examples don't include movie studios and theaters. It is much closer in many respects than store brands, which are quite different in market share as well as production."
862,"Wow, this is an awful idea.  So should supermarkets not be able to sell their own brands?  They compete with a third party distributor, so obviously Senator Warren believes they should not.  The goal here is for the government to gain power & control over the free marketplace of goods and services that the internet represents.  They don't have the tech powers under their thumb and it drives them nuts."
863,"Her proposals are evidence based, thoughtful and supportive of average Americans.  Unfortunately Americans hate educated women and don't want a professor.  She'll never come close to producing the enthusiasm that Donald does with his overt appeal to Christian white nationalists.  sad"
864,"Regulations is what sent Americans jobs off shore, it?s not that i?m against regulations when they make sense. The problem with the Warren?s of the world is they are suspicious of big business of any kind. It goes back to the Evil 1%, who Socialists like Warren would like to chase off shore It?s the 1% that made America Great."
865,"Yes, stupid is as stupid does.
Let?s take America?s greatest companies - worldwide enterprises- and cut them
Up.  Great idea....for failure."
866,"Most bricks and mortar stores sell their house brands and have done so for decades - but let me guess - the Internet retailers are somehow magical in Liz Warren's mind.

She has no plan for 'breaking' up companies - she just wants to target companies that she know her base will reflexively cheer her on for destroying. 

In so many ways - she is exactly like the Trumpster - it's all about the base and the heck with a rational policy."
867,"Though I agree privacy and security and advertising are in desperate need of regulation, it isn?t one size fits all. I hate Facebook, always have never signed on and am thrilled in retrospect. They are not trustworthy in the least no matter how many times they are caught apologize, and do worse next time. 

I have a serious objection to breaking up Apple?s ?walled garden?. Many of us love the simplicity and the safety that such a tightly integrated hardware and software mfg offer, Apple in particular.  And they are way better at maintaining my privacy and no serious viruses or hacks have occurred for me. android phones might as well be made of Swiss cheese for all the security vulnerabilities. Who can say that google or twitter or Facebook protect out privacy or security well? No one. 

So we need to be careful and specific to each company."
868,"Big Tech is going to cause the next recession unless the Apple, Amazon and Google are turned into national utilities.  As they become a larger and larger part of the economy, companies like Uber are pricing their own employees (or contract workers) out of being able to afford anything from these websites.  When this happens, the advertising revenue business models will fall, because the fewer people that can afford things the less relevant advertisement becomes.  This will lead to huge job losses, which will further exacerbate the problem--because it will mean even fewer people can afford things.  Ultimately, this will necessitate the government nationalizing these three and probably Uber too--and many places like Pinterest and probably Facebook going out of business in the next 5 years.  Make no mistake, the party is almost over.  These companies rely on the masses for their customer bases, and with growing inequality and less purchasing power for the masses, this will lead to a recursive contraction that will end up bursting in SPECTACULAR fashion in the next few years. The only way out is to nationalize these companies and have them guarantee a living and spending wage for their employees to sustain growth.  These companies, however, only care about the interests of the small amount of shareholders, yet depend on everyone else for their success.  That is the definition of unsustainable. They are all slowly sawing off their reproductive organs, and guaranteeing their demise"
869,"As a person who works with electronic data daily, I can tell you that there are some real serious challenges with some of the things proposed in this.  

For instance, if you require that people be able to view the data that is collected about them, what format does it have to be in?  Just a download of a huge, unusable binary file?  If it has to be formatted, who has to write the code to format it, and who decides what an acceptable format is?  Our user data is spread out across several hundred database tables and providing someone access to that data.  It contains all kinds of flags and fields that are used for technical purpose.   Do you want to see raw data?  Summarized data?  How do we know that it is really you asking for the data, and not a hacker?  Would you need to have a login and password for every site that could potentially track your data?  All of this represents serious amounts of work and investment of companies that track data.  

As for restricting platforms from providing services, it would be very difficult to draw the line to divide these up.  Do you shut down GMail because it is provided by Google?  What about Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Photos, or Google Analytics?  

There are many other challenges, but I am running out of space. 

I think the idea is nice, but people need to understand that these services and platforms are the result of many, many years of development and will take just as long (if not longer) to change."
870,"It seems Senator Warren is one of the few presidential contenders who recognizes a major issue facing American democracy is the rise of monopolies and oligopolies, where one or a few corporations control an entire market.  Jonathan Tepper's new book ""The Myth of Capitalism - monopolies and the death of competition"" is a very accessible account of the transformation of the American economy from free market competition to what we have today.  Helps answer the questions: why wages, innovation, and productivity have stagnated while prices rise, consumer privacy disappears and customer service languishes?  Conclusion - oligarchs are strangling American democracy and sucking the blood out of our economy."
871,"At least for Facebook, the American people can minimize the effects of it by simply stop using it and minimize our dependence on it.   Market forces are much more effective than regulation.

If we feel threatened by Amazon's power, then start shopping at your local retailer (Of course you would have to ignore Walmart's effect on offshoring a large part of US manufacturing)

If social media bullying is affecting you, then disconnect from social media and it miraculously goes away.  If Devin Nunes thinks that Twitter is doing him irreparable harm, then he should just ignore it.  If we are going to govern our nation by 140 character utterances then we don't deserve to survive."
872,"The actions of a government are not a racial characteristic.  They are the decisions of one or more individuals.  To characterize criticism of the expansionist policies of the current  government of Israel as racism is not only a fantasy, but a violation of First Amendment free speech rights."
873,Defining a religion as a state? Nothing could be more in violation of our constitution's requirement for the separation of church and state.
874,"This seems illogical.  Revise the language in the Civil Rights Act.  It is absurd to treat Jews as a race for the purpose of falling under this protection.  As for nationality, Jews belong to the world, not a geographical country.   Judaism is a religion."
875,"Re: ?...This is our message to universities: if you want to accept the tremendous amount of federal dollars that you get every year, you must reject anti-Semitism, it?s very simple,? Mr. Trump said at the signing ceremony...""

I can only wonder:
What must it be like to be a 'civil rights' lawyer in an administration which supports, (alleged), neo_nazis S. Bannon / S. Miller as policy_advisers, praised Charlottesville's homicidal Neo_Nazis, (despite the Heather Heyer-homicide), 'N, retains a proud serial - homophobe, (VP M. Pence), as an example of this administration's, (serially, alleged), 'Xian' beliefs???

Might it be like being an ice_salesperson on R.M.S. Titanic?"
876,"Without knowing the full story behind the University of Pennsylvania student discrimination case, I find it disconcerting that a male student should take issue with rejection when his admission was based only on the support of one individual as well as  ""multiple-generation legacy status.? The notion of legacy status is ridiculous and serves to entrench and deepen socioeconomic disparities and restriced access to higher education. Shame on him for espousing this privileged attitude. I believe in affirmative action, and beyond that, acceptance should be based on merit."
877,"It?s one thing to be hostile or discriminatory to a person based on religion, sex, ethnicity etc, but it is quite another to criticize a nation or government for its policies. I don?t see how a US court could uphold not letting people speak out about the nation of Israel?s policies or any other nation, including the US.  It is too great of an infringement of free speech."
878,"Who is Trump to declare anything? This is another ridiculous move by Trump.....Judaism is a religion that SHOULD already be protected! The idea that it's necessary for purposes of civil rights enforcement, to declare a religion a race or some sorta national origin is absurd, and in my opinion is another form of prejudice."
879,"Other than the Roman Catholic Church,  Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, evangelical Christians, Zionist Jews and extremist Muslims no one believes in the existence of a Jewish ' race'."
880,"I'm disappointed by all the angry comments. Judaism has always been more than a religion -- it is also an ethnicity. We call ourselves a ""nation"" in our liturgy. Anti-Jewish bias is a huge issue on college campuses, and just yesterday Jews were murdered in Jersey City, one of thousands of attacks a year. Anything that can help us fight bias is a good thing. It has nothing to do with how American we are."
881,History is the enemy of Americans.
882,"This executive order serves Trump's political interests and  will only make life more difficult for Jews in America.  It will result in Jews being perceived as a preferred minority and therefore further divide Jews from other American minorities who support the Democratic party.  That's a win for Trump/Kushner.  It will silence criticism of Israel, and satisfy the Trump Evangelical base.  Another win for Trump/Kushner.  
Jews must speak against being labelled by this racist president."
883,"Its beyond ironic that the President who claimed that some Nazis were  ""Good people - and you know it""  is now twisting the First Amendment to become a supposed  protector of the Jews. It is not so much that the Trump administration is a bulwark against antisemitism as he uses  the threat of antisemitism to get at groups his administration find objectionable.  I have read nothing about Trump's efforts against the right wing antisemitism that produces the bulk of the actual hate crimes."
884,"What Trump is doing may not necessarily help fight anti-Semitism or better define Judaism.  That said anti-Semitism on college campuses and in our institutions of government must be strongly addressed.  
In Congress today we have at least 3 members who insist that supporting the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement (BDS) is valid and without bias or prejudice toward Jews and is only directed economically at Israel and Israeli business.
BDS is clearly and vehemently anti-Semitic.  BDS targets Jewish businesses, Jewish institutions, Jewish organizations and Jewish identity and Jewish beliefs.  Worse, it is not only an attack on Jewishness in Israel it is a directed attack upon the Jews of the United States.  
What BDS does follows precisely what the Nazis did in Germany in the 1930s before the wholesale slaughter of European Jewry began. Nazis began political attacks on Jews and also began ending rights of citizenship of German Jews. Jews were vilified and targeted as the cause of German economic woes that began after World War I and the Treaty of Versailles. Nazis began reprisals and boycotts of Jews to avenge their defeat and the economic depression. Jewish businesses, organizations, institutions were boycotted and banned. Boycotting Jews and Jewish businesses culminated in the beginning of the Holocaust atrocities with Krystal Night when thousands of Jewish businesses and synagogues were burned. 
BDS supports boycotting American Jews. That is anti-Semitism. BDS is Nazism."
885,"It's always suspect when a politician supported heavily by anti-Jewish groups goes out and defines Judaism.

Because you know, the Nazis ALSO defined Judaism in a similar way..and then they used that definition for evil.

The KKK, Nazis and other groups are salivating for this legislation because it's literally a great way to make lists of Jews. How could that go wrong?"
886,"I recently read ""I Will Beat Witness"" by Victor Klemperer, a Jewish humanities professor who survived in Germany all through the Third Reich. To the end, he reviled Zionism - even as many friends found safe haven in Haifa and Jerusalem - and clung tightly to his own identity as a modern European rooted in our common humanity of ideas and culture available to all, evolved beyond outmoded tribal, religious, and national feeling.

""To me the Zionists, who want to go back to the Jewish state of AD 70 (destruction of Jerusalem by Titus), are just as offensive as the Nazis,"" Klemperer wrote in June, 1934. ""With their nosing after blood, their ancient ""cultural roots,"" their partly canting, partly obtuse winding back of the world they are altogether a match for the National Socialists."" (Page 68 in the hardcover edition).

Even in December 1941, by then forced to wear a yellow Star of David on his lapel, Klemperer wrote: ""Hitler is the most important promoter of Zionism, Hitler has literally created the 'Jewish nation,' 'world Jewry,' {the} Jew."" (Page 450-451, italics for the bracketed definite article).

Were Victor Klemperer to appear today on an American college campus and state views like this, he would run afoul of this new Trump administration decree and risk that campus its federal funding. Such is the peril of allowing politicians to define groups for their own political ends. Were I Jewish, I would find this all quite creepy even if I supported Israel unconditionally."
887,Strange. The individuals going round shooting Jews don't seem to be university educated liberals.
888,"The idea of conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is baseless and dangerous. Zionism was developed in Europe in the late 1800s  as a project to establish a homeland in the Middle East mainly but not exclusively for people practicing the Jewish faith. One can take serious issue with the manner in which this was done, and the current policies of that country without being the least bit anti-Semitic. If this Administration were truly concerned about religious discrimination, they could include religion in existing legislation and refrain from engaging in a dubious rebranding of Judaism to require support for the present concept of Israel and otherwise suit  alt-right extremist interests in the US and Israel."
889,"Clearly Jews are discriminated against in what amounts to racism -- sometimes. I'm (genetically, obviously) Jewish, but I haven't really experienced it. But we know it's a thing.

On the other hand, I very much disagree with the idea that arguing about the right of the State of Israel to exist in its current form is anti-Semetic. Israel is a religion-based nation -- a theocracy -- and as someone whose grandparents came to this nation because of freedom of religion, I'm befuddled as to how American people could be saying, ""You can't argue against the existence of Israel.""

That's crazy talk, to my ears. I'm against the establishment of any national religion, anywhere, because it obviously can lead to people feeling unwanted in their homeland."
890,"Hmmm, I think this is a good decision.  It will be another wedge of divisiveness between Americans, even in Progressives.  I am  a Liberal/Progressive/Leftist, whatever you want to classify it as, and have always been disturbed by what seems clearly to me to be unconditional condemnation or anti-Semitism from the Left, as well as the unconditional support of Muslims."
891,So Trump et al. are going to force colleges and students to be pro-zionists. Boycotts are not about Israel they are about an illegal expansion of Israel's borders into Palestine. How committed is Trump to the zionist cause? as far as Adelson's checkbook.
892,"Are American citizens who practice the faith of Judaism citizens of this country, or are they jews who live in America?"
893,"My religion is Judaism.

My nationality is American.

My U.S. Army dog tags make that abundantly clear.

The last time Jews were defined as a racial/national group rather than members of a religion ended badly -- about as bad as anything in history ever did -- at places called Auschwitz, Treblinka, Chelmno, Sobibor, Majdanek ...

Anti-semitism is rooted historically in Chrisitan religious libels of Jews. Those and what they have caused are bad enough through 20 Centuries of hate. 

When race is layered over that, it leads to genocide.

Witness the fate and condition of the Rohingya in Myanmar, hated for their religion by the dominant Buddhists, characterized as a parasitical race.

History's dots connect. Spare me, literally, spare me from this one."
894,"Let's clarify things, please. Judaism is a religion, not a country. Israel is a country; it is not Judaism, although it is considered to be a Jewish state. Many people, including many Jews as well as non-Jews, are disgusted by the Netanyahu government in Israel. Many people, including many Jews as well as non-Jews, are disgusted by the Trump government in the US; a parallel analogy is that the US is a country, not Christianity. 

Disliking the current administrations in either country doesn't make us/them anti-Israel, anti-America, anti-Jewish or anti-Christian, just anti-the awful governments currently in place.

There - clearer now?"
895,"My God! 

Betsy DeVos has done everything she can to give religious schools, non Jewish, but Christian schools every advantage.  Vouchers for religious, Christian schools, paid by taxpayer dollars.  Ring a bell?  So unfair to public school kids.  Now Jewish debate?  

Oh, take back time.

Betsy DeVos does not even have a college degree in education.  And her college education was provided at her choice by a Christian, religious college!  

Ouch!"
896,"This tells me who is on my side and who is not:

'some liberal organizations opposing it. Palestinian rights groups were incensed.'

What saddens me is that the group at the center of this firestorm, the BDS, has US Congressional support from The Squad, with Rep Omar (D-MI) being a strong supporter of this group.

How long before she starts pushing their agenda, and starts pushing for financial and military support for the PLO and Hamas?

I am genuinely worried that the enemy of my people now have a voice and vote in the one group capable of determining the fate of my people, the US Congress."
897,"I think YouTube is great with its voluminous videos on entertainment, news, how-to's, educational materials.  And I can control what I watch. Just because something is recommended to you doesn't mean you have to watch it - if I click on the ""not interested"" button, the entire topic disappears and they stay disappeared.  You can subscribe to content providers that you like and just watch those videos.  If I come across content from someone that I am not familiar with, I do a bit of research before watching their videos.  YouTube provides enough parameters for me to control what I want to watch.  In these days, we have to actively take the initiative and be responsible for the sources and content of what we choose to watch - with ""choose"" being the operative word.  It is not YouTube's responsibility to save you from yourself.   I have nothing to do with and no connection to YouTube, other than being its user."
898,"If the Times wants to truly understand why more and more people distrust them, look no further than this incredibly unfair and inflammatory article. The Times now labels anyone outside their own liberal editorial policies as ""far-right"" and deliberately seeks to marginalize anyone who is conservative as ""lacking direction"" and/or easily manipulated.
The Times would never profile someone who fell into the ""far-left extremism"" of Daily Kos, Media Matters, Young Turks, Rachel Maddow, etc.

Most of the clones that listen to NPR all day are surprised and confused to learn there are alternate viewpoints.  Once they learn about alternate viewpoints, they then are introduced how to label such opinions as 'racist, bigoted, xenophobic' and so on. 
It is unfortunate that this passes for dialogue in 2019."

He seems to be willing to adopt any ideology presented to him with decent production values. This is strange. But even stranger is how Mr. Cain?s malleability is derided by the New York Times when it leads him toward Conservative views and praised when it allows him to be molded into a good, orthodox Leftist. 
The other thing I find most interesting is what I?ve observed for several years: the use by supposedly respectable journalistic outlets of the blanket scare term ?alt-right? to encompass people as different from each other as Dave Rubin (a gay Jew) and Jared Taylor (a white supremacist). This is irresponsible at best and dishonest & propagandistic at worst. 
All of this leads to what my own public school indoctrination in the 1980?s told me would never happen: the American Left screaming for censorship, book-banning, political violence, and personal physical violence perpetrated against people whose only ?crime? is philosophical disagreement."

I think the people who create the youtube videos, their message, and what they are really like as human beings is more interesting than some victim that views it. In simpler terms, I more interested in Trump than the sixty million people who voted for him.

But this incessant, imprecise focus on social justice is just another form of us/them and I'm getting really tired of it, and so are a lot of other people just like me."
910,"Speaking from a country where media is heavily censored, I can tell having a platform to speak freely is great and Youtube provides this. Many Turkish journalists and TV reporters, especially the best ones, are now making videos on Youtube because they can speak without the fear of government censorship. 

I believe that Youtube should take important steps to prevent such extremism possibly by adjusting its algorithm. But, as long as people see a range of different opinions, such a platform is a very important asset."
911,The billionaires who run Google/Youtube (and Facebook) love their money and status but claim they have no ability to significantly remove hate speech from their algorithms.  These companies should be made financially and criminally liable for extremist mass murders if they don't clean up their platforms.
912,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  User-generated content platforms like YouTube and Facebook must be regulated by the FCC just as broadcast radio/TV platforms are required to do.  The concept of ""the public interest"" must be re-introduced and/or the companies who own these platforms must create content standard review boards before anything can be posted.

Will it slow down the rate of content postings?  Yes.  Will it mean the companies won't make as much money?  Also Yes.  But what is the alternative?  More radicalized white guys who shoot up synagogues?  More incels who plow vans into streets full of pedestrians or shoot up yoga studios full of women?

We know the tech companies will not do anything substantive on this issue until the government forces them to take real action. Their ""algorithm tweaks"" are nothing more than PR stunts, giving people the appearance of action but falls way short of what really needs to be done.  In the meantime, #deleteFacebook and #deleteYouTube.  Fox News is a Disney movie compared to what passes for content on their sites."
913,"The mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and the Democratic Party have gone son far to the Left that even a Centrist or a position slightly Right of center is characterized as ""Right-Wing Extremism""."
914,"The real question is why are these Youtubers, while non-stop smeared, demonized, demonetized and censored, corporate powers trying to limit their reach as much as possible, still inherently popular and with a loyal following. 

Could it be that they simply address the questions and issues our corporate media won't ever touch as it could destroy their prescribed narrative?

For example the multiple, well documented failures of the currently prescribed 'multiculturalism,' which itself is in the corporate media non-stop served as an outmost strong, close to a religious dogma. And any dissent against which leads to treatment similar to the treatment of the above mentioned Youtubers."
915,"Thank you for this fascinating investigation.

No one seems to be answering (or even asking) the hard questions.  Whatever YouTube's (or Amazon's, or Google's, or Facebook's) changing standards for guiding & manipulating our on-line behavior, those standards will be in the service of the company's profits, not our well-being.  Interacting with an algorithm written to give you the information you want to hear is not research.  It is not a conversation.  It is not even a mirror, for it picks out & amplifies the aspects of your interests that it can fulfill.  The bottom line is that all internet ""social media"" is profoundly antisocial.  It responds to human communication not by listening & responding, but by spying, isolating & peddling.  It is a one-way mirror in which we cannot see the algorithms behind the glass, constructing the versions of ourselves that benefit them.  If there is any way to make this kind of manipulative mediation compatible with free speech, individual thought, or democracy, I wish someone would explain it."
916,"In the article substitute ""video"" with ""book and ""YouTube"" with ""library"".  Is this a different perspective? Have we been here before, or is this something completely new?"
917,"""... that innate I.Q. differences explained racial disparities ?""

Oh the irony. Any one  with an innate IQ above the temperature  of freezing water 32F would upon reading/hearing the old IQ trope would immediately move on to something else. Try phrenology, that's the ticket, measure one's IQ by feeling the bumps on his head.
An educated individual who has developed at least some modest level of critical thinking skills can not be radicalized."
918,"First, this article is emblematic of so much discourse today. Under cover of 'journalism', you treat a set of ideas or a political stance as an object or phenomenon to be explained, not as something you have to engage or argue with based or reason and dialogue. Here NYT pathologizes a set of perfectly legitimate views by lumping them together with racist and sexist cranks. The Right is a social pathology to be interpreted, diagnosed and cured, a kind of therapy that requires Leftist critique. 
Second, we're becoming a hyper-hermeneutic society, placing far too much value and authority on what essentially are subjective interpretations. Imagine if each person was attributed an ideology based on how a media critic interpreted the totality of their media consumption? This is the equivalent of reading entrails or tea leaves but masquerading as social science and journalism. 
Third, it makes sense that NYT would want to delegitimize these sort of outlets, as educated people rejecting its journalistic authority means less market share and less political influence. But for more and more of us NYT and other media giants are not a source of reliable news. NYT is now just a catalog for the ultra-rich. Imagine Gwyneth Paltrow's goop magazine selling ideology to the Brooklyn set."
919,"A few of the commenters here complain about a ?lack of balance? in this article, that the ?radical left? isn?t taken to task as well. I?ve noticed that those complaints share an abundance of spelling, grammatical and other errors, for instance, ?It was intriguing....? instead of ?It would be intriguing....,? ?russian?  for ?Russian,? and ?theorys? rather than ?theories,? to cite just a few. The current occupant of the Oval Office shares this penchant for linguistic mistakes in his tweets and statements. I wonder if there is a correlation between the aforementioned illiteracy and the Neanderthal social and political philosophies espoused thereby."
920,"The article does a nice job of describing the toxic mix of lies that play on the negative emotions of ignorant people. One element that was not mentioned; the extremism of some left-wing culture warriors that provides the right with ready-made ""proof"" that liberals are out to destroy America. This could be leftists who clamor to abolish ICE (are open borders reasonable?), radical feminists who portray ambiguous and completely non-violent sexual encounters as ""assaults"" that the woman ""survived"" (abuse of that term is an offense to women who have survived a life-threatening attack), activists who cry racism without regard for the facts of a situation (see the Twitter mob that played the willing fools for criminals stealing food from Chipotle), abortion zealots who can only see restrictions on abortion as men trying to control a woman's body (never mind that Roe v Wade explicitly recognizes society's role in protecting the living fetus). Even the mainstream media displays a biased take on issues of gender and race. Has the Times covered Caster Semenya's or the US Women's Soccer team's lawsuits in a balanced manner? Do publications casually apply negative qualities to ?white men? as a group when doing the same thing to women or minorities is (correctly) unacceptable?  No doubt this comment will trigger many to mistakenly claim that I am denying the very real significance of racism, sexual violence, and sexism. For ideological purists it is just easier to feel the outrage."
921,Seems misleading to include Milton Friedman as a far right youtuber?
922,"The American Dream is not arm's length away, it's miles away. The dream isn't something you are given it's something you earn and accomplish. You must not give up because you are stuck and barriers are being put in front of you. You must knock those barriers down get past those mountains and rise above and succeed. Hardship is a great way to accomplish your dream but failing is even better. Learn from your mistakes and take the risk others won't. Even if you fail 100 hundred times you don't give up because you only need 1 time to succeed."
923,"The American Dream is not an elevator, raising you up from the ground floor to CEO floor. Instead, it is a dirt road full of winding alleys, gorgeous sea paths, hilly trails, roundabouts, detours, and dead-ends. Whether we arrive at our destinations or not isn't the essential part. We should be happy and grateful just for the gift of this journey. On the road, many more gifts reveal themselves: the gift of choosing a lifestyle, a religion, a spouse, a friend, an education, a set of values. The gift of meeting an obstacle, of choosing hope, of overcoming challenges. My parents immigrated to the U.S. for its education and job opportunities. But their American Dream was not limited to themselves; they wanted to provide their children with a positive, nurturing environment. They have trudged thousands of miles on the road of the American Dream and have found the land they were dreaming of along the way. Now, they are community volunteers, dedicating their lives to service. This is just one American Dream. Determined by an individual?s choices, the American Dream exists in many shapes and forms. Because the capacity of human hope is limitless, the American Dream lives as long as we do."
924,"The American dream is alive.  The American dream is different for everyone.  Some people vision of this is to be much more accomplished than another person may see their own dream. I believe that the American dream can be attained by anybody through hard work sacrifice and dedication. My dad group up in Italy, when he came here to start a new life he had to work hard. He now owns his own business and works hard everyday to maintain a good reputation around are town. He also had to work really hard to create his own business and keep it running solid for 20 years. Every time we talk about his business he tells me it?s not easy to run a business and keep everybody happy. And that's how i know he works hard."
925,"As the daughter of two amazing and loving moms, my life was made possible by artificial insemination through sperm donation. I am in an unusual situation. I don?t celebrate Father's Day, I can?t participate in father-daughter dances, but I do get to shock the less educated kids when health class rolls around every year. I also have 18 half-siblings who are all the product of my anonymous father?s sperm donation. My father and my half-siblings are my blood, but to my father and most of my half-siblings, I am a stranger. 
My biological father prefers to remain anonymous, so even though he is my birth father, I don't really consider him family. The same goes for most of my half-siblings, who I mostly have internet relationships with, aside from three who I have actually met.
My birth mother?s side of the family is no more welcoming. My uncle has not spoken to my mother practically since she was born and replaced him as the youngest. My aunt seems to think I do not exist. To the two biological families that produced me, I am an outsider. 
Thankfully, I have a third side built into my family, the family of my adoptive mother Meggie. No one in the family is blood-related to me, but they show me love. The people that I call my family, the ones with whom I do not share a drop of blood, nor a strand of DNA, are the ones who care about me and show me what real family means. The ones who love you through your flaws and want the best for you, I think those people are your family."
926,"The American Dream is very real in my life. I am a strong believer of the American Dream and am very thankful to know that I am living it right now. To me, the true American Dream is to live in a nice house, with a healthy family, and go to school, then later on have a successful job. My family has been so great to me and have set me up in life to live the American Dream, which I am so grateful for. I look up at my parents as a perfect example of living the American Dream. They both grew up living not the greatest life, but they both went to college, then got successful jobs. Now, they have raised a great family. My parents have given everything they had to make our family happy and healthy. My parents are very humble, but I know that at the end of their lives, they will be able to look back on life and know that they were very successful parents and lived the American Dream. My mom and dad have paved a path to success for my brother and me, now it is our job to continue the American Dream."
927,The american dream now not only is about the job opportunities and the money but safety too as other people have commented. The living standards in places like Venezuela and Guatemala and other southern countries are unbearable with the lousy government and lots of crime and fighting. That is why people flee their country and why the american dream has changed. When the american dream started it was because people saw better opportunities than those in their country like the stories people told. I agree that the american dream is not equal for everyone and there are some prejudices taken before people are given opportunities and some people will have it easier to make it big. At least more than ever people are being treated more equally now than ever and although it is not perfect it is not the worst.
928,"To me, breathing exercises are only a temporary solution to a bigger issue. Practicing mindfulness is good for panic attacks and more urgent situations but as soon as one finishes meditating,"
929,"I believe the American Dream is different to everyone. To me, the American dream means opportunities, hard work, freedom, equality, and achieving stability and happiness. I think people often think that coming to America automatically means a future of success, and automatic opportunity, but in order to live the American dream, it requires hard work. I believe the American Dream is achievable for everyone if they make the most of their opportunities. I learned a lot from my dad about hard work. He grew up in a middle-class family and worked hard all his life. He worked part-time jobs in high school, served in the U.S. military, paid for his college education and worked to get the job he has now. My dad taught me that nothing in life will be handed to me and that I have to work hard in the real world to live the American Dream as he does. My parents are able to look back on their life and say they?re proud of their work ethic and what they did with their life. I hope I can look back on my life at their age and know I worked as hard as I could at whatever I end up doing, and actually enjoy doing it. I live a very privileged life to be attending a boarding school, like The Governors Academy. In my everyday life, I try to remind myself to take advantage of it as much as I can. I always try to put all my effort into my school work because I don?t want to have to look back and think I could?ve worked harder."
930,"American Dream

	The American dream can be interrupted in many different ways. What the Ameican dream means to me is how fortunate I am to be living such a good life. I am thankful for my parents always putting me before them to make sure I?m happy. My parents want me to live a better childhood then they had, and that is paving my way to be successful. I am truly thankful I am able to attend a private boarding school because it is helping me receive the best education possible. My parents have already got through their Ameican dream, so now it's my turn to live the American dream. I am currently in the middle of my own American dream. After reading other students responses across the world it makes me think how easy my American dream is. All of my family is from America which made me one step ahead of all those kids with parents or grandparents from outside America. I strongly believe that the meaning of American dream has changed over the years because in the 1900s many people immigrated to the United States to live in the ?promised land? or the ?Land of opportunity.? Now, with kids like me are able to be born in America making it easier for me to fulfill their American dream. Finally, I think that the American dream is what you make out of it. It is all based on how much hard work you put into being a successful person in America today, and the harder you work, the more successful you?re going to be. Hard work pays off."
931,"To me, the ?American Dream? can be defined in many ways depending on a variety of different factors. These factors consist of where you are from, where you grew up, how you were raised and the biggest factor is how one looks at life itself. Being a privileged white female who was born in Massachusetts, growing up in a little town called Byfield and raised by a loving mother and father along with having a little sister, my ?American Dream? is going to the college I believe is right for me, graduating and then going off and pursuing something I love. Then after accomplishing that, being engaged in a healthy marriage with the right man and raising a happy healthy family. I just want to die knowing that I worked my hardest to be the best person I can be and knowing that I am happy with who I am. If you asked someone else with a completely different perspective on life, they could have said there ?American Dream? was just getting into college, or not going to college at all. Unless, having materialistic things is what one strives for, as long as a person is happy with their life and who they are, materials do not matter. Every person should learn to be happy with what they have and value the little things in life, to me this can make a big difference in someone's life. The ?American Dream? is whatever one desires it to be and can always be changed in order to live life to the fullest."
932,"The American dream is real.  For some people though, the American dream is much easier to reach than for others.  In my family, throughout the generations, the American dream has come from very hard work.  My Great Grandfather came to America from Sweden and had to work hard to accomplish what he believed was his American dream.  The American dream is different for everyone.  Some people vision of this is to be much more accomplished than another person may see their own dream.  My grandfather is another who had to work hard for what he believed was his American dream.  Working hard everyday to provide for his five children in hopes that they would be given the oppertunity to fulfil their own American dream."
933,"The American Dream to me is similar to that of many other Americans. I feel as though everyone has a different perception of the American Dream. Depending on where you are from and essentially what your childhood life consisted of. Since I was young I have always remembered hearing the words ?American Dream? and ?White picket fence? in the same sentence. The American Dream resembles everything I hope my country to be. The ability to have education throughout your life while still being able to chase other interests such as sports for me. The ability to get a job and have income to support my family. The idea of having food in the pantry and a roof over your head. I?m grateful because for me I think that I am living the American Dream. It also have to do with what family you are born into. In my case my parents and grandparents lived a relatively blue-collar life. Both sides of my family come from small town New England suburbs. They worked jobs and went to schools which allowed them to go to college which ultimately set my life up. I grew up in the same small town my Dad and Grandfather did. Like my Dad, I attend prep school and will likely have an opportunity to attend college. This is the American Dream in my mind."
934,"American Dream are the conditions to have growing in my life. Without oppresions, with many liberty to choise my way."
935,"I believe that ""the American dream"" means the hope of a better life where everyone has the opportunity to advance in their social mobility and succeed in life. For most immigrant dreamers, their family is an inspiring base, as they recognize the efforts that many parents and family members have made so that they can live in a country with better opportunities and social and economic conditions. From my perspective, love, mutual support should be the main component in the concept of family."
936,"American dream, 
    Without dream, you're not exist. If you want to have a better life, you must have a dream. Always have a plan, built your calender, respect delay, reinforce your capacity building. America give us a lot opportunity to achieve success. Having motivation and being educate are the best ways to make your dream came true."
937,"In the article I am reading about ?American dream? it's a privilege that we can have. Everyone has dream when come here in United States because we have many opportunity. firstly it is very difficult adapt in new country, but if you want to have a better life, we should work hard and try to reach our goals, each person has a different dream, therefore, there that we should work and continue with what we want, and also have to inculcate our son that we have to work hard to have an American dream."
938,"The America Dream for different people lives for everyone is different and many people wanted to move to another social class. For every person is different it could be wealthy or affluence so, with a lot of determination, effort to achieve your dream you also need support and family."
939,"The American dream is dead, because we don't have any values anymore. People only care about possessions, about things, about money. However some people do have a dream and hey want the dream become true,But is the American Dream really endangered, or has it simply been misplaced? Exploring the way our aspirations have changed."
940,All immigrants have a purpose in life to have american dream for many people is difficult because they leave everything in their country. some of them have the opportunity to have an education and learn different languages. Since in their country they do not have the resources to achieve their dream.
941,"In my opinions, ?the America Dream? for everyone is different and real . Every generation has their different way to think and do and for me is that the important thing is to get a bachelor degree and get a better life with a lot of happiness and I know is not going to be easy like I think I have to work hard to achieve it."
942,"In this article we can realize that ""The American Dream"" is different for everyone. However, I think that if we all have a different perspective of what ""American dream"" is, we come to the same conclusion that it is an idea of ??having the opportunity to achieve success and increase our social class. We also know that always the factor to get ahead is to work hard, we must always think that with the effort carried out by our hand we can achieve unmatched things."
943,"The ""American Dream"" for everyone is different  , every generation think that but our imagination sometimes is not our reality,  to be honest  our priority should be go to the college and get same degree i believe this is a better decision for make true our dreams. The life not is easy but with effort and sacrifice we can reach another social class and be successful"
944,these responses are memorable because most of them talk about the people's lives that were lost. These student's responses really hit close to home.
945,"Ona Stocvaz, J.R Masterman, I agree with the part ""My grandmother had to work her way to achieve this experience, she did not sit around on the couch and binge watch Netflix all day. To achieve the American dream, you have to try to achieve what you want in life and want to achieve it."" I agree with this, because things aren't going to happen the way you want it to happened."
946,"There are profound differences between investigative journalism and propagandist mud slinging. When you set out to discover and convey relevant facts objectively, that is called journalism. When you are determined from the outset to attack rather than to inform, and instead seek to misrepresent, obfuscate, or lie to push a predetermined storyline with ulterior motives, that is called propaganda.

President Trump and his right-wing supporters described here are seeking to silence or punish Trump?s critics. They are not attempting to address particular facts, analyses or criticisms. They make no pretense about conveying information objectively; their goals are simply to exact revenge and to muddy the information waters. 

There are profound differences between journalism and opinion. Unfortunately, in all the noise of modern media, it appears that many people, including President Trump, conflate the two. One consequence is a devaluation of facts, analysis, and objectivity in favor of easier ?gut-level? subjectivity. Given Trump?s very loose connections to the facts-based universe (yes, that is my *opinion*), this devaluation of objective facts is precisely what Trump and his supporters seek to achieve. 

To quote Chico Marx: ?Who you gonna believe? Me or your own eyes??"
947,"I expect to know the beliefs and interests of politicians running the country. If I respect someone's reporting, I'm not sure if it's any of my business what they do in their social media accounts. I will always react negatively to any expression of racism, homophobia, sexism, etc. but I don't hold journalists in awe, either. (Charlie Rose, etc.) Glad he's out of the picture, but that was for actions. Is posting on social media in actionable action? I don't know? Opinions?"
948,"I fail to see why this is a problem. Why does a statement's age have anything to do with its veracity? How many years in the past does the statement need to be to get immunity?

Journalists, especially at center-left and left-leaning organizations, are exempt from criticism of their racism and 'problematic statements.' We call it the Joy Reid Rule."
949,"Journalists have a great deal of power and should be regulated for competence and bias. 

Of course, that will never happen. 

Making sure they have skin in the game is a good idea. Doxx them."
950,"In other words, conservatives have adopted the same tactics used by progressives for the past two decades.

953,"""...coverage deemed hostile to the White House.""
That's cute.

A) Not the White House; Trump.
B) Did we really need the ""deemed"" in that? 

Hostile to Trump has been the MSM M/O for the past three years. Or are you saying you've been misunderstood this whole time?"
954,"how does your own medicine taste? the framing of your article indicates it tastes really, really bad. 

just wait till the rest of the tactics youve employed are realized upon your own selves, even as they were explained to you trying to reason with you that these policies are awful, and warn about the historical consequences... it gets so much worse before it gets better. the longer you double down, the more obvious your manipulation will become, and the pain of low ratings, budget cuts, layoffs, and bankruptcies will compound exponentially. you have the choice to make, return to unbiased reporting and continue on as a company, or continue propagandizing political opinions and spreading the lies of your master unto your inevitable corporate failure. rootin for you, but also aware of history, surprise us! return to truth!"
955,"Wow.  Talk about being able to dish it out, but not take it.  

You talk a lot about ""the public's right to know.""  Well, when someone holding a responsible position at one of the country's most powerful institutions has sent out a bunch  of vile anti-Semitic and racist tweets, doesn't the public have a right to know that?  Doesn't the public also have a right to know the NYT's response, about which I haven't seen a word in the paper?

Are you telling  us that the Times doesn't dig into every corner of the past life of any conservative who comes to public prominence in the hope of finding something damaging?  Well, I suppose you could tell me that, but I wouldn't believe it.

I remember, for instance, that when John McCain was running for president you published a story strongly suggesting that he had committed adultery based entirely on innuendo rather than evidence.  Now you're pointing the finger at big, bad ""conservative operatives"" for exposing your employee's disgusting behavior.

I hold no brief for Donald Trump.  In fact, in a letter published by your newspaper, I called him ""epically unqualified""
 for the presidency.  But I'm still appalled by your consistently hostile coverage, by your news stories and now even headlines that read like editorials, and which you feel obligated to change if, by some mischance, they merely report what  happened yesterday, in other words the news.  

Don't worry about ""conservative operatives.""  Take a long, hard look in the mirror."
956,What?s good for the goose...
957,What's Trump trying to do? Popularize the legitimate media.  I thought that Trump voters had an insatiable appetite for lies and sleaze and that politically incorrect slips in the NYT would increase readership. I hope the Times has the back of it's writers and exposes the poor quality of the mud being slung. Can't  the Time's writers assign a common set of phrases to cover Trump shenanigans. Remember flip flopper? It worked for the Republicans in 2004.
958,"Does anyone care about these supposed ""exposes,"" given that they are being created fans and supporters of a president who famously and continually lies?  Given all the true-and-decidedly-unflattering stories about Trump and every member of his family that are currently well-known and, frankly, believed, do the Trump ""exposers"" really think they can provide their own incriminating garbage that will have any impact?  This is the ultimate ""Enemies List"" mentality at work.  It did not work for Nixon.  Does Trump believe he can outdo Nixon?"
959,"This group of ?private citizens? is a disturbing and a direct frontal attack on media members who are not kissing up to POTUS. This is how media is controlled in authoritarian nations, such as Russia, Hungary. POTUS, without question, is more than aware of these activities with Junior and Bannon directly involved. So, the central question is their funding source. Since no dollars are apparently coming from the re-elect Tromp committee or the RNC, Follow the money! One must suspect ?dark money? from the Mercer family, off shore money channeled into a Delaware-based LLC from untraceable sources. Our ?friends? in Moscow must be pleased for this assault on one of our most cherished freedoms. This is more advanced than using Facebook without accountabilities."
960,"Pathetic. So, so very sad."
961,"Every president since Woodrow Wilson (in 1913) has given press conferences on a fairly regular basis.  These press conferences have given the opportunity for the president to clarify the positions taken by the administration.  We all recall the single press conference open to the White House Press Corps which Trump held (I believe in the East Room) about 2 months after his inauguration in 2017.  It went very poorly, and he called out a reporter or two claiming that they represented ""fake news"".
Since then, formal White House Press briefings have generally ceased, and the president only does one-on-one interviews with select correspondents.  Spontaneous Q&A's occur on the White House lawn when Trump is about to board the helicopter.  These encounters are brief with often only one-line comments from the president...nothing in-depth.  
President Trump's primary method of transmitting his thoughts and ideas are via Twitter!  Basically, he says what's on his mind... and that's it.  Many of the president's tweets are critical of the media, politicians and celebrities.  
Somehow, all of this is supposed to replace formal White House Press Conferences and Press briefings!"
962,"""The operation has compiled dossiers of potentially embarrassing social media posts and other public statements by hundreds of people who work at prominent news organizations""  

I've long believed King Minus (our president) has a boiler room operation getting dirt on people -- people he hires (so he has something on them) and anyone who threatens him. Now it's journalists. I've no proof, but this odious operation bolsters my belief. More like the mob than the government of the country I love."
963,"I am not sure whether this is closer to blackmail or to extortion, but in either case those attacked should be supported by their employers.  A statement that this sort of attack will not work, no matter what, would be appropriate.

That should apply not only to tweets from when someone was 15 or 16 years old, but also to more egregious offenses publicized by this group that under ordinary circumstances would deserve attention and punishment.   
 
Only thus can this operation be nipped in the bud.  Otherwise, it will succeed."
964,"I think part of this hit piece comes as a result of Politico releasing a transcript of a meeting of NYT?s staff that demonstrated just how biased their reporting is. I?ve read about it in other outlets, not here. 
And I will believe this paper really finds this behavior outrageous when I read a hit piece about Media Matters here.

966,"So, the Trumpettes are taking a lead from Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee during the commie purges of the 1950s. Bravo guys. And they resemble the leadership of the KKK in their efforts to intimidate people in practicing their constitutional right of free speech as well as freedom of the press. They are also camp followers of Nixon and his ?enemies? list. All brave, true American patriots. Not. Equating journalists? investigative activities with propaganda from the Democratic party is a real stretch since there are many different views and ideological positions among Dem candidates for the presidential nomination. Journalists aren?t beholden to any candidate.

Are some journalists biased? Sure. Start with Sean Hannity if you consider him a journalist. Opinion writers for the New York Times and the Washington Post are expressing their opinions; they are not investigative reporters, though there may be some on staff. It?s difficult to undo actual contradictory statements and tweets of the president that have been recorded. He said what he is recorded as having said. No propaganda or fudging there, even if he denies what he said.

The anti-journalism supporters of the president are pursuing an old tactic pioneered by Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The difference, so far, is that these two men had their opponents murdered. Putin still does. These guys are aiming to kill journalists through skullduggery."
967,"Not to worry, people. Eventually Schwartz' efforts will become so much detritus on the airwaves and trump will throw this would-be goebbles under the bus, as he has thrown everyone who thinks they're safe in the anointed one's sphere."
968,"""Conservatives"" sure are a bunch of whiners.  They can't deal with the facts, so they attack the messenger, just like Trump's buddy Putin.  It doesn't get more un-American than that."
969,Funny how the NYT and it?s readers are very concerned about youthful indiscretions creating problems for reporters.  They never seem concerned about the damage they do to Republican politicians and supporters.  I?d like to know what  a NYT reporter who is supposedly independent has said about a topic.  It might make me think twice about the veracity of their reporting.
970,"Imagine being so hypocritical. Isn?t this all public information? That was the justification for the Castro?s campaign doxxing of Republican donors. Isn?t this the same exact tactic commonly employed against Republicans that Democrats do not like? Aren?t journalists public figures who influence minds and opinions? Seems like we should know if their, for example, criticism of Israel may be motivated by anti-semitism, especially given how often Israel is demonized in this newspaper. Have even a shred of self-awareness. You brought this on yourself. Journalists are not immune from criticism."

973,"Trump has shown that he values loyalty above all other qualifications.  Not loyalty to the country, but personal loyalty to Trump himself.  And Trump has shown seemingly little reluctance to ask his appointees to break the law or stretch it to the breaking point.

Nominating a partisan DNI who apparently doesn?t believe the findings of the intelligence agencies that he would control and  who has little experience in intelligence does not auger well for said agencies.

?The best people? seems to mean ?the best sycophants.?

I?ve little doubt the Republican senators will cave to Trump as they usually do."
974,"If Susan  Collins says she is ?concerned? about this nomination, it?s a sign she will vote to confirm.

After, that is, she meets with Moscow Mitch who will tell her he promises that her concerns will be addressed. With a post office in Maine."
975,"This latest deplorable move from the current occupant of the White House has only one interesting aspect to it. Once again, Republican senators- because of their oversight duties for cabinet-level appointments- will be put on the record as favoring or opposing a completely unqualified individual for a crucial position in this administration. ""Moscow Mitch"" will, of course, already be counting noses well ahead of time, so the probability of Senators actually having to vote ""on the record"" is slight. Three nays will do the trick, and the name will quietly be withdrawn. Can anyone remember when, if ever, another administration had so many ""trial balloon"" candidates rejected? The answer can be found by noting that we've never had such a blustering buffoon in the White House before. EVER!"
976,"Who are republicans trying to kid, Ratcliffe has no experience or qualifications for the job. He over inflated his role in U.S. v. Holy Land Foundation. He's exactly what trump is looking for and every single republican Senator will vote for him."
977,"Well,if tray gowdy endorses Mr. Ratcliffe,clearly the candidate is reasonable and objective. Cf. The bengazy hearings."
978,"I take issue with your phrasing...""cast doubt"" connotes a  persuasive argument, based on evidence, against a certain position.  Merely asserting doubt as opinion does not meet that standard."
979,"It now appears John Ratcliffe is a fabulist who has padded his anti-terrorism bona fides. This may be enough to derail his nomination. If it does, it may result in Trump having to nominate someone suggested by a legitimate source such as Senator Burr."
980,"We live in a surveillance state. Big data knows every move you make. 

Every. Single. Move.

Now politicize that collected data and put it all at the disposal of the delusional criminal occupying of the White House.

How long before ""his"" politicized Justice Department starts having ""his"" politicized FBI knock on people's doors in the middle of the night? Who in this country - including all of the so-called ""powerful"" people - will be free of the grip of this mad man?

This is going to make the darkness of Nixon's ""enemies list"" and the surveillance and blackmail of civic leaders under J. Edgar Hoover's FBI look like child's play."
981,"Personally, I think Congressman Ratcliffe will make an outstanding Director of National Intelligence.  After all, he is an unqualified partisan hack with next to no experience in the craft of intelligence, and is someone who lied on his resume about his experience in prosecuting terrorists. These are all prerequisites for prestigious appointments in Trump's wonderful world of ""intelligence."" 

He can also draw on the deep experience of other partisan hacks and Trump himself to do his job. For example, why pursue counterintelligence investigations against Russia when Putin has assured us that he's as pure as the driven snow? Why seek to ensure election security when Putin has offered to do it for no charge? 

Furthermore, why not relocate all the intelligence agencies?  They are obviously too close to Washington, and those bothersome facts they come up with are very irritating to the White House.  Like Department of Agriculture scientists, CIA  and NSA analysts, particularly those who come to the wrong conclusions, should be given the choice of moving to Kansas City or losing their jobs. 

So much to do, so little time..."
982,"So, ?Make America Great Again? is apparently the same as turning America into Communist Russia."
983,"So they voiced concern.  Republicans are very good at voicing concern and then voting lockstep with most extreme of their party (i.e., Trump, Graham, McConnell, Cotton, Jordan...).   We will see if they again cleave to the depraved character that is now the loadstone of the ""Grand Old Party""."
984,"The congressman's defense of Trump showed he is incapable of processing fact dispassionately. 
He'd be a disaster as a conduit of hard information between  America's vast and complex intelligence operation and the intellectual wasteland that is Trump's mind.
So he'll take the easy way out and tell Trump only what Trump believes to be true."
985,"The director of national intelligence writes the daily intelligence briefing given to the president and his people. The report weaves together information from 17 intelligence agencies. Obviously, that vital role requires an open mind, curiosity, an appreciation for complexity, fairness and dispassion. Ratcliffe showed little of those things in recent months. But hey, he?s loyal to Trump and that?s what matters, right?"
986,Those willing to stand up to Trump who have the necessary experience probably don't want the job.  That leaves partisan hacks who swear they will be independent and Republican senators who have to hold their political noses when they're nominated.
987,Trump gets squirrelly if he feels threatened. That includes being seen as incompetent. So everyone just lets him be when he goofs up. He needs people who validate his perceptions. People like Ratcliffe can easily do that because they do not know any better.
988,"In the end, the Rs will line up behind the political hack du jour."
989,"Don't forget this is the guy who proclaimed himself ""Paul Ryan's little brother."" Oh, brother, where art thou?"
990,"Americans are right to worry that our intelligence and military communities are being denatured in an effort to divide, weaken and ultimately destroy our democracy. 
We?ll soon find out if there are enough loyal Republicans to step up and do something, anything, to derail and unmask this clearly overt attempt by Putin and his helpers to split us , one from the other, for their profit and amusement."
991,"Too bad the polls were so wrong in 2016. Such an error might lead GOP Senators to ignore recent polls that indicate Trump is not heading for re-election. Or, maybe they are cognizant of Trump losing, which hopefully emboldens them to vote with a greater sense of propriety vs. party."
992,"Don?t fret. They?ll cave, like they always do.

997,Waiting for the principled Sen. Collins to cave has become a well established drinking game in Maine.
998,"In the United States, expectations for us boys tend to center on avoiding weakness, for example, not crying because tears are seen as a sign of vulnerability that threatens our masculinity. Instead, aggression is a strategy often modeled and employed by us as an approach to exhibiting masculinity. This emotional limitation can have dire consequences on us though. For instance, holding back tears can cause troublesome health issues such as over-time high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes. Additionally, suppressing emotional tears is equivalent to repressing the emotions that lead to it. Subsequently, the repressed emotions (e.g. sadness and anger) can heighten and exacerbate your emotional state. However, by crying we can release our stress and feel better. Therefore, the notion that ""boys don't cry"" can be considered a negative stereotype, one that us boys generally face with considerable difficulty."
999,"Thoughtful article and public comments, that is, once you get past the article's title..why in 2019 is this still a ""secret?"" And WHY NYT's do you continue to promulgate stereotypes by calling this history ""secret???"" Can we get a BETTER title?  Why not just call it ""A History of Coding""? instead of subjugating women's part to something that STILL, until now, but never should have been, secret."
1000,"I think the problem must have started way before 1984.  I graduated college in 1978, and my recollection is that most programming classes had < 15% women in them.  Back then, there really were no personal computers that people might have bought for home use.

When I was in *high school*, computers were already thought of as pretty nerdy."
1001,"Industry is going to have to make an effort, but frankly so are the women who want to be in the field.  Its not going to be an easy path and you are going to have to fight to get what you want .. its called life"
1002,"I started programming in 1968. My Algebra teacher was a woman programmer. She had worked for NASA, and programmed the software that coordinated the LEM - CM rendezvous.  In my professional career I interacted with many women programmers. Usually, they are more concerned with the fine details than the men. Oddly, the only people on my first team that openly challenged my decisions were women! I appreciated their devotion to quality. A great team is made up of diverse skills and abilities. That diversity includes gender."
1003,I just want to express my appreciation to the author for a wonderful article.
1004,"There is no doubt that the tech industry has two massive failures with regards to inclusion-- African-Americans and women. In both instances, despite sometimes Herculean efforts, limited progress has been achieved.

While at Google, I watched as the company worked aggressively over a three year period to increase the number of women software engineers. Despite no shortage of resources, the progress was minuscule, about a 0.05% increase.
 
If the tech industry is ever to address these gaps, clearly bold, experimental, and non-traditional approaches are required. Doing more of the same, even with an increased gender emphasis is unlikely to succeed."
1005,"Another ""secret"" is that coding --computer programming it was called - was a deadend job in the 60's and 70's which is one reason why: a) there were lots of women (low pay, no career opportunity) and b)the numbers of women thereafter went down.  I somehow knew when graduating with a master's in math in the early 60's to steer clear of programming (as well as typing) and was ultimately able to forge a successful career in finance and investments.  I did some wonderful ""modeling"" (solving business problems with elementary math concepts, which were then ""coded"" by the programmers --though I knew enough to find their mistakes.)

But in the main, computer programming was full of dead ends in that era.  Please add to your ""secrets""."
1006,"Very interesting article as I was unaware of the early history of women in computing. To add to what was written I think much of the computing ""industry"" has pushed out the talented liberal arts majors who could slip into the field in earlier decades.  The increasing monoculture of male programmers also makes the situation worse for everyone who is different, I mean normal!"
1007,"I started with a Business Studies degree from a university in England and specialized in what at that time was ""MIS"" Management Information Studies. The focus was all on coding and efficiency of hardware, etc. After completing my studies I narrowed my career choices down to Accounting or MIS. It was a no brainer that entry level accounting would start at about 2500 GBP and require continuing education and certification while MIS started at 3500 GBP and they would pay for you to learn on the job. This was in 1977. For most of my career there has been a good proportion of women in the field. At one place the Programming Manager was a woman. Most of her team were men. I moved back to the US in 1989 and worked in IT. After a layoff in 1990 I joined a small software firm as a consultant implementing the software at many companies. I remained in consulting until just last year. I noticed a dramatic shift away from hiring women to develop and implement software. My last job started out with three women consultants, the rest were men in a team of about 20. By the time I retired we were down to just me and a new hire woman and many more men. At 65 the job was no fun anymore, and without fun and challenges it's time to get out. I tried to encourage more women to take jobs developing software. But they were worried they couldn't do it, even though they clearly had the ability. We need more women developers."
1008,"While I noticed the trend of declining female enrollment in CS from the mid 80s and onward, I was stymied as to why this was the case until I read the explanation about the accessibility of PCs being the driving cause.

Men's behavior, and yes, I am a man, also contributed significantly. Firing Damore, rather than helping, just exacerbated the problem."
1009,"At my techy company, we have a goal of 30% women in the workforce (we are at 23%). Whenever I post anything about that goal I always get comments about ""how we shouldn't have quotas"" and what is next, 50%?   Or we don't hire woman because there aren't that many STEM women. They didn't hire female summer interns in my group because they were only given males to interview, despite my location being next to a 50,000 student State University.  I did hear one of my higherups saying he will require that at least one woman be interviewed for any job. That will make the recruiters try a bit harder."
1010,"Two things:
I can't say I've seen a decline in the number of women involved. Maybe it's just the companies I've worked for -- mostly financial services and all here in NYC. But there have always been  women and men working together, and women in the position of technical lead or manager. Of course, I have no idea whether they're paid more or less at the same position. The one time I observed rampant misogyny was at a Japanese car maker's US site in California. Made my skin crawl and I left after a few months. 

You state: ""It might seem strange now that they were happy to take on a random applicant with absolutely no experience in computer programming. ""

Why strange?  Most of the programmers hired today have no real experience, cannot communicate effectively, and because everything has to be coded fast, no idea how what they produce effects other code in the same system. They are hired ""in bulk"" from consulting firms whose only qualification is that they work cheap. 

I've been in this computer business for 38 years.   I've seen it go from a group of engineers building terse, elegant solutions to sloppy code produced by moving icons around a screen,  that wastes processing resources (i.e. money), and depends on the public to fix the bugs.  Somehow, like the Presidency, programming got demystified so the assumption is that anyone can do it."
1011,"It's encouraging to see that changes have been and are being made, at least in academia.  Industry will catch up when companies find that they are missing out on half the pool of talent.  Some thirty years ago when I was in academia I wrote a proposal to NSF that included the sentence ""the under-utilization of women in science in this country is a national disgrace.""  The school administration made me remove it."
1012,"This was a fascinating article.    When the job was considered 'secretarial' it was 'delegated' to women, and then when it became more and more important in mainstream life those in power took over.

I grew up in India, where it was culturally very accepted to study Computer Science.  My parents encouraged me when I joined a Computer Science program, and my larger network of relatives and friends considered me a success when I did well.   I then earned advanced degrees in the U.S. and now work in the U.S., but the cultural support I had early on has paid me rich dividends.   I am unafraid to speak in meetings where I am the only woman, and I don't feel the need to attend conferences focused on women to feel empowered.  My sense of empowerment comes from a different place - the strong cultural push I had for women to take up careers related to working with computers.  I see the  difference between my attitude and the attitudes of my colleagues who started their Computer Science education in the U.S.   Women in India face many challenges, but studying Computer Science is not one of them."
1013,"My principal takeaway from this article is that there are legions of managers and educators (in addition to technologists) who have shallow grasps of their ""businesses"", and may even be stupid.

I bet that an analog to this article could usefully be written about the age discrimination that pushes out engineers and scientists (how many of them last into their forties?) ? but deploring age discrimination has never been as trendy as deploring gender discrimination.  Both deprive STEM fields of capable people."
1014,"The most significant, and obvious, imbalance in the field is not the proportion of men to women, but the proportion of foreigners to Americans."
1015,"Many turn of the century (last century) astronomers were women for this same reason, the dull and monotonous work required scorned by men.

When science progressed to complex and hard to replicate experiments, data became more valuable and those doors shut, or like Frank's were stolen.

I like the article but I feel it lacked the historical placement. Women will continue to take the work others scorn. When it becomes seen as a path to success it will be taken back by men. Society as a whole has become more sexist recently, but hopefully we can swing the pendulum back the other way."
1016,"Why would a rational woman read this article (and the comments about what a horrible career being a programmer has been for the women commenting) and choose to go into software engineering? Why not go to medical school, law school, or business school and skip the misery and discrimination?"
1017,"great article, now lets focus on integration not separation.  ""Girls only"" may be a required step but make it a step."
1018,"okay, after reading this, anyone recall the software store babbages.  ever wonder if it should've been named after his partner instead, Lady Ada Lovelace?  admittedly, I do not know whether Ada adopted his last name which would answer that."
1019,"I've been a professional programmer for 40 years. I have no idea how I've lasted this long. I had a few run-ins with sexist male coworkers but they got in trouble for their behavior but that was in 1990s. Today, men can behave badly and nothing happens to them. It's sad but I believe that it's a reflection of the lack of civility in society today. 
I saw myself in this article. I work as a software engineer, the only woman in my area of the company and the oldest developer. I see and feel the age and gender discrimination daily. I'm not giving a pass to my manager by saying that he doesn't realize what he's doing. He realizes perfectly what he's doing and he doesn't care because he can get away with it. I will say that the other developers give me respect for my ideas, too bad my manager doesn't.
Trying to get hired in 2019 is ridiculous. Everyone is a software engineer and every company thinks they are Google or Microsoft so they have to give whiteboard interviews. I'm not sure what it proves but it definitely favors the younger developers who recently graduated from college and gives them the edge to get the job. If I could do anything else that pays as well, I would get out of this field immediately."
1020,"Our daughter is a Harvey Mudd 2013 grad and I'm glad to see the college recognized for how it encourages women in CS, as well as other STEM fields. And so satisfying to read the concluding example about the three high-school girls and their hackathon success---may they triumph over the sexism they are now encountering."
1021,"Math is hard. So is medical school. The medical profession has seen its proportion of women increase. The mathematical professions lag in comparison. Which career field is perceived to be more appealing?

Perhaps a key to getting more women into technical fields is to make those fields more attractive for _anyone_ to go into."
1022,"I began programming in the late 70's and working in IT in the early 80's.  Seemed to me that the work environment at the time was no more sexist than other fields and maybe even less so, although it was a generally more sexist time.  The rise of bro culture seemed a much later phenomenon.  There was some of this effect at the beginning of the Internet - in the days of ""consensus and working code"" ruling internet networking standards, aggression and confidence were boons.  The rise of gaming was another burst of mail dominance.  But the real rise of bro culture took place in Silicon Valley with startup fever where aggression, ambition, obsession, and confidence drove everything.  At the same time I feel this change drove the sorts of products coming out of IT - the 70's and 80's gave us TCP, HTTP - the internet.  From 2000 on, IT gave us Facebook and Uber and AirBnB.  Engineering to marketing in a few decades.  Diversity leads to better technology."
1023,"The first time I heard women were at one time more prominent in the field of computers was, ironically, reading an article in the Arts section of the Times about the TV show ""Halt & Catch Fire"".
One of the people who commented on the article recalled that when he first started in the field, there were many more women in the field than later in his career.
That was a revelation to me. Thankfully, this man did not seem to have a problem with it. I guess in his day the environment was more congenial when more women were there."
1024,"This is one of the most important meta-analyses of this disturbed monomaniac and charlatan.  Thank you NYT for assembling these data, I have bookmarked this for future reference."
1025,"Raise you hand if you were accused for over two years of something you didn't do (but there was evidence of an opponent doing it), would you just sit there and take it? Or would you defend yourself? The corrupt Mueller investigation, which never investigated a specific charge, used phony FISA warrants based on news articles, colluded with the democrat party and the media to rid the country of a lawfully elected President."
1026,"From day One, it has always been about his conciseness of his own guilt. It has also always been about pleasing Putin. It has always been about pleasing Putin to conceal his own guilt. What a dynamic, decades of money laundering for the Russians, decades of philandering, and still he could not control his own lust for the ego trip of running for President. May the Trump name soon get the infamy it deserves."
1027,"So? What is wrong with Trump attacking the ""Russian collusion"" and related investigations if he believes they are based on politics, by people who want him out of office? It's starting to appear that is the case. The bi-partisan U.S. Senate committee report included 200 witnesses and two years of study, and could not find anything. Yet the Times goes to great lengths -- listing each day the President defended himself against news stories -- to keep this thing going. 

What happens if Mueller concludes he could not find exculpatory evidence of ""collusion""? Will the Times continue to grasp at straws until Doomsday?  What about former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe's effort -- based not on evidence beyond published reports about alleged Russian influence -- to encourage ousting an elected President? That's a real story."
1028,"You just keep doing you, NY Times. We love you."
1029,Donnie is doing Putin's bidding daily so of course he would bash the Russia investigation.  Conspiracy in plain sight just like Hitler.
1030,"President Trump should criticize this investigation. 

The documentation to justify the investigation origins do can not withstand cursory scrutiny let alone judicial scrutiny. This investigation is the result of a political opposition research with the assistance and collusion of Russian government officials no less. The irony can not be thicker. The same government officials now deemed to be nefarious.

The Special Council has taken the role of Washington's Praetorian Guard protecting the bureaucracies, the political establishments and the media."
1031,"If Trump spent as much time working to run America as he does blaming people, belittling American civil servants, and being a general pain in the rear we might have had real, well thought out tax overhaul, a much better health care system, an infrastructure project, and an administration that had accomplished something.  Oh well, I guess, depending upon whether not Trump wins, it could be another 4 or 8 years of our lives being worsened because the GOP cares more about being in power than it does about governing."
1032,"If criticizing prosecutors and protesting one's innocence are obstruction of  justice, every convict released by the Innocence Project should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. Obstruction of justice consists of such things as concealing evidence, tampering with evidence, procuring false testimony, etc."
1033,"How is ""attack"" defined in this analysis?  Is that definition applied consistently?  Is there a threshold at which text is considered an ""attack""?

For example, ?we wouldn?t even be talking about this subject? and ?real collusion? does not sound like an attack.  Whereas something like ?low-life leakers? is an attack.

I?m just trying to point out that this analysis is not objective if text was interpreted by a human who decided whether it was an attack. Possibly you could use some type of machine learning sentiment analysis algorithm, but this is really only determining if the text is negative, neutral, or positive ? but not necessarily an attack."
1034,It is incredibly clear that 45 is a crook trying to obstruct his legal consequences.
1035,"And why shouldn't he attack these bogus ""investigations?"" Every single day the mainstream media --the Times and others-- have been poking him with sharp sticks and roasting him on a slow-turning spit. You think he should just turn the other cheek? How many people would do that? How many are made that way?

It's like school yard bullies who drive you nuts and then laugh at you. We deplorables are watching what you do. Don't think we're just mucking out our barns all day... You may be fooling yourselves that you're taking the high road somehow. You are not."
1036,The Times has provided a valuable service by providing these data in chronological and quantitative form.  Psychologists and political scientists will pore over them to make their case for Trump's psychopathology and criminal obstruction of justice.
1037,"The correlation of events and attacks prove to be very interesting  - very interesting. We all - all of We the People -  need to be able to see every page of the Mueller report whether vis our own eyes but of ALL of our representation in Congress.

(How anyone can possibly defend trump with a straight face is beyond me! It is totally elementary!)"
1038,Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Justice everywhere you look. Trump does it plain sight.  He reminds me of Gotti.
1039,For someone who claims he isn't guilty of doing anything wrong. Donald Trump certainly gives the exact opposite impression.
1040,"If you're innocent you welcome
an investigation. Attacking the investigation will not make it go away.
Such behavior has a way of amplifying the investigation. What's 
astonishing here, is Trump's slavish devotion to praising Putin and things Russian. Br'er Rabbit was smart enough to scream his hatred and abject fear of the briar patch. As a poor little rich boy,Trump must have missed out on the story. But as a cultured, highly educated New York multi millionaire with a ""very, very large brain,"" it would seem impossible he could miss being exposed to Shakespeare's Hamlet and the immortal line, ""the lady doth protest to much, methinks.""Investigators will soon lay out their case and accuse Trump of treason. There will remain, sitting smugly in the Kremlin, the the brains of the operation, Putin. Our replacement president, Pelosi, shouldn't order him assassinated, as tempting as that
may be. Together with our rejoined NATO allies, sanctions so severe should be put on Russia that the Russian people do the work for us. At that point, Putin and his criminal gang of oligarchs will have the trillions of dollars they stole from the Russian people repatriated to the national treasury and the country can begin its journey back into the league of democratic nations where transparency, a free press and the 'rule of law' are the cornerstones their governance model."
1041,"Only 1,100 times? Should be many, many time more! Russia is, and always was, a complete hoax, it seems some still are not understanding this FACT."
1042,"I can't believe that someone paid you a salary to chart this stuff. The Senate Commitee just finalized their investigation stating that ""there is no factual evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia."" It is a know fact that Russia did not change votes or affect the election in any meaningful way....if anything, they paid for some advertizements on social media disparaging both Trump and Clinton to pit Americans against Amercians (man, did they succeed there, huh?) It's 2019 people...the election was almost 3 years ago. He's your president. Move on. Maybe print soemthing nice that he working on instead of wasting your time charting words that you don't agree with? This week he's pushing for the global decriminilizational of homosexuality. Can't we all just find some common ground for once? If not, maybe next week you should chart his bowel movements?"
1043,Wow id is definitely collusion! Do you have some number in mind on how many times he should attack if he would be innocent?
1044,"The nonsense here is that you guys spend all your time reporting every slight and cut Trump utters. He could pass gas and you'd report what note it was. He tweets like a maniac, so I hear from you, because I have never looked at one of his tweets, not once. Why should I? They aren't policy statements, they aren't binding, they are hiccups. But your staff runs over each other to report them, then report how bad they were, then report how many times they occurred. 
The next President, Sen Bernie Sanders, gave the speech of his life rebutting the Orange Ogre after Donald's STOTU drama. It was brilliant POLICY. You ignored it, but reported the neoliberal boilerplate that Abrams sputtered on about, that be unremarkable out of a kid running for HS student council. 
I expect you to play Trump from now til 2020 like a Marshall speaker feeding back Jimmy Page at a Led Zeppelin concert, down Sanders at every turn, and I expect America to ignore you. Enjoy the irrelevance."
1045,"When we finally get to the real story, it is going to be a lot worse than most everybody thought. I do believe that he is compromised by the Russians. But I believe that we all think that he and his mob family are outliers. They are not.

The entire Republican Party has been compromised, including some of those who were/are serving in Congress. Like Rohrbacher, for instance, but it probably goes much deeper than that, especially with the campaign contributions. If this does not spur us to get the money out of politics, I do not know what will."
1046,"I wonder if eventually Mueller and his team will ever find anything . . . it would seem, with a high powered team, that after a couple years they would at least start picking up tidbits of evidence."

1049,"I am Indian. My husband is white and Jewish. Our son looks like he could be Southern European or - certainly here in L.A. - Latino. I appreciate the writer's thoughts about race and the individual and honestly have very much lived my life in that way. Despite a few isolated racist incidents, my life - largely because of my choice of cosmopolitan, diverse locales - has been that of an individual, not a race. That said, racism is less about how we as individuals define ourselves than how society categorizes us. Systemic racism isn't the same as prejudice or bias. Someone calling me or my kid a name isn't the same as a cop shooting a Black man because of the color of his skin. I'm all for the individual flourishing and defining him or herself as long as we don't delude ourselves that the systems in place see us that way. And that we fight to change that."
1050,"Article thought provoking, and comments more so. People?s experience of ?race? is really what matters here, as much as a new utopia of a post-racial world may be wished for. ?Whiteness? as prized is not exclusive to the US and Europe?s complicated history of slavery. India?s Brahmin class is ?whiter? than the lower castes, and cultivated. As is lighter/whiter skin in China, Japan, Korea, etc. Would love to understand the origins of this cross-culturally. Meanwhile, as long as we ?otherise? people for their color, creed, sexual-orientation, gender, politics, etc., and fail to exercise the Golden Rule, humans have a long way to go. Even in the future mocha-colored world, there will be groups who elevate themselves and marginalize others to feel ?better than?....."
1051,"Who is that said, ?The personal is political.?"
1052,"Thomas Chatterton Williams?s narrative reinscribes the story of Coleman Silk in Philip Roth?s ?The Human Stain.?

Coleman Silk is a black man who chooses to pass as white. After giving up a promising career as a boxer?at the behest of his hyper-correct black middle-class father?Silk endures an unhappy stint in the Navy before becoming a professor of classics and dean at a liberal arts college in the Berkshires.

When his statuesque Scandinavian girlfriend rejects him after meeting his mother and sister, Silk decides to marry a Jewish woman, strategizing that her Jewish afro will provide cover in case his children happen to have kinky hair.

Silk?s career is destroyed after he innocently uses the term ?spooks? to refer to two absent black students. His masquerade comes to an untimely end when he and his newfound paramour, the uneducated and abused wife of a traumatized Vietnam vet, plunge into an icy river in his car. The two are the victims of a diminished and enraged white masculinity.

Cleaver is not worth quoting. More Baldwin, Morrison, Roth, and Gates.

Williams?s narrative unconsciously fetishizes whiteness. Blackness is not celebrated.

And what does it mean to observe that his daughter is paler ?by a standard deviation[?]?

When your children come of age, explain to them the significance of their maternal grandmother?s slave head, then smash it to smithereens.

The truly enlightened view identity as contingent and accidental rather than an ?eternal reflection.?"
1053,"I find this to be an illuminating exploration of the subjectivity of a man ""outside"" American racial categories. It is strongest when sticking to that approach. 

It is weaker when projecting that subjectivity onto others, in particular, his maternal grandfather. The author, when viewing photos of him imagines interior experience that follow not from that man's perspective and position at the time, but through his own in retrospect. 

The author writes about a photo, ""the parents inhabit a country that does not yet have civil rights, and they are posed with an unperturbed air...""  What would a member of the Vietcong or Cuban revolutionaries see? What colonialist psychology would they also reasonably ascribe to them? My point is that the author selects the historical moment relevant to himself and views the photo through that lens. Entirely understandable, even useful. But, largely arbitrary and yielding little if anything about another's subjectivity. 

This meaning, this interpretation, this projection, far from stemming from inhabiting the other man's place (""even knowing that he was failing yet unable to help it"") as implied can only be from the vantage of the ""bi-racial"" grandson. As such, it reveals the subjectivity of the writer. Only. 

If one really wants to inhabit another's perspective, then a very different kind of work must be done. Not ""neutrality"" but empathy is called for. I think it would only make this piece even stronger."
1054,"Thoughtful, sincere, and illuminating article."
1055,"great article. reading this, made me think with new way, new aspect."
1056,"Very interesting. We visited family this weekend. I was chatting with my step son-in-law (it's complicated). He is biracial with a name that easily identifies a specific ethnicity. I have a name that does not ""match"" what I look like (visually, I'm obviously a minority in the US).  I was relating a story about how complex it can be to be visually ethnic in our society, and how being a ""minority"" sometimes invites unwelcome comments. His response was ""Well, I'm not a minority"" - a head-spinner because to the naked eye, he is absolutely a member of an ethnic minority as are two of his children. I wonder what is his thought pattern, and how is he going to prepare his children to understand and most importantly. overcome things children or other people will say to them, both positively and negatively. I know it's very complicated and he obviously felt strongly that he's Caucasian.  My step-daughter and her sister both married ""outside their race"" and their brother has not forgiven them for it. So maybe it's a protective guard he's put up. I worry that his children are going to feel like they need to pass a white, or be upset that they cannot pass as white, because their father -who looks exactly like them - seems so entrenched in thinking he's only white... They need to understand from the get-go that they are beautiful and valuable as who they are, and deserving of being treated with dignity and care."

1058,"Just have Valentine ask her grandmother to put the slave head in a drawer when she and her husband and their children visit. Pretty soon, the grandmother may wake up and get rid of it permanently.

Old people are so accustomed to their possessions that they don't always see their connatations clearly any more."
1059,"Still, upon further reflection, and having at last finished this, alas, torturous read, I keep landing upon what another comment touched on:  that most of these mixed-race lads end up jettisoning the black side of them, marrying white, marrying ""up,"" and not that there's inherently anything wrong with that, but why is that, though?  I see precious few mixed race men marrying black women.  This adaption from a longer work seems to touch on just that:  a disquieting reality among some people of color playing up their white ancestries as leg-ups in a sea of ochres, browns.  Even this author's seemingly black father is rescued by the qualification that he's red-brown---and he even has freckles!  Williams reminds us again and again he's half Northern European.  The word blond comes up as if heavily underlined.

I wasn't surprised this color-obsessed author married white.  His essay is a paen to the longing to be white, to be accepted.  I am curious why this seems to be a phenomenon in communities of color, and I say this as someone from a rainbow background myself.  

A black guy once told a physician relative of mine he'd never marry a dark-skinned woman like her because he wanted children with good hair.

In short I get these messages from this essay:

""See I'm whiter than Tiger Woods, who isn't even half white, but who wants to be white, we all know that!""

""See I'm even whiter than Obama who is only half white!""

Love your children for who they are, not how blond they are."
1060,"A few years ago I took the 23andme test. My results came back over 99 percent European, but there is that 0.4 percent Sub Saharan African ? specifically Congolese ? that is there. It does not appear to be a fluke or a testing error because it also showed up when one of my parents tested as well. I don?t know where it came from. No black or mulatto ancestor shows up in any of the records I found, going back to the 1600s. When I wrote about it for the local paper, someone posted a comment, apparently seriously, that I was now ?black? because of the one drop rule. I assume no one who is actually black would appreciate if I started referring to myself as black because of some remote ancestor. I don?t believe most states classed people as black using the one drop rule until fairly late in history either. We would probably be better off without all the obsessing over race."
1061,"When you call 911 to report an assault the operator will ask if the assailant was white, black, or Hispanic. She is not asking about his clothing, language, outlook on life, ethnicity, or weight, although those things may come up later in the criminal justice process. At that moment she just wants to help police officers identify the criminal as quickly as possible.
 She is asking you to make a guess about two things: first, where his ancestors were living five hundred years ago-- the biological part of race-- and second, where in your opinion that puts him in the racial classification currently in use-- the sociological part of race. 
Most people can make fairly accurate guesses because race is both a biological and a social construct. If race were not partly biological she wouldn't ask that question because it wouldn't be useful.
Full disclosure: I'm blacker than Rachel Dolezal and more  American Indian than Elizabeth Warren."
1062,"A beautifully written article.  The ""racial issue"" in the U.S. has seemed absurd to me since the 60's when I was in love with a black man.  By American identity, he was black, but in fact, his roots were mohican Indian, French, and African American.  He was from Louisiana.  

I, as someone born and raised in Germany until I was nine, was, ironically (since I was born in 1943), not aware of racial prejudice until I came to the U.S.  Race, to me, had top do with your roots, to be celebrated as a point of interest.

Those who today, still cling to the notion that if you are a fifth black you are black, make it very hard for young people of mixed race to find an identity.  It is time to let people be simply who they are, a quarter Irish, a quarter Mexican, an eight black, and an eights Puerto Rican, and four sixteenth unidentified.  

Whatever the mix, and we are all a mix of cultures and races (remembering that parts of our DNA goes back to Africa).  It is time our identity is be based on our values, and cultural norms without thinking about the ""racial"" aspects. I think also, that the question of race needs to be wiped out of our data bases."
1063,"It's always seemed to me that, for others, marriages happen in part to safeguard the children. As long as any group of people is subject to danger, just for existing, there is seldom a way of knowing whether one of one's reasons to marry out of the stigmatized group is to lighten the burdens of one's children.
I live in the SW so being Mexican American has a lot of history here, as does being Native American. Native Americans have passed as MexAm even with all the trouble that bears to avoid worse troubles for their families.
Survival is the name of the game. 
The self blame that comes with this adds to the pain. 

On the other hand for me, having heard too much of what polite people hide, I found it increasingly difficult to be close to people who do not share a similar degree of social stigma, even if they're not from the same group. And by now for real, we ought to know that being mixed is almost universal for long time Americans at least."

1065,"Amitava D in Columbia Missouri opens with these words
?There's no denying Mr. Williams is a superb writer. But ultimately race is what you choose to make of it.?

Not in America Amitava D. In my USA each baby born is tagged with a ?race? name at birth. That tag is then seen as essential information by physicians meeting new patients, hospital admission departments, even college Admissions departments with Harvard the worst.

Affirmative action policies apply to people whose ?race? is designated. Worst of all, American medical researchers produce epidemiological studies in which self-designated race black or white is seen as a key variable. That might be valid if there were a genetically pure group A ? call it white ? and its counterpart group B ? call it black, but there are no such groups.

In Sweden, there is one group whose members hold that scientifically indefensible view, the neo-Nazi NMR and even some members of the SD party.

 Let us look forward to a future TCW essay here in which he draws on the part of his book devoted to 

UNLEARNING RACE.

1068,"Wow - a very truthful, insightful & considerate view of how things are for you when you have this history. Thank you ! Mine was a mixed marriage, to a black West Indian, so my kids are of much the same experience as this writer's, altho not so American since we only migrated here as a family from the UK in the late 70's. I still find the total divide between 'black' & white hard to put up with, hard to feel optimistic about because of the deeply embedded historical slavery status within both groups. It becomes just as difficult when you are white to be in a black group - a silly example was at a party with my son's American black in-laws, had been enjoying the vibrant & very civilized & highly-educated group, when I spontaneously tried to kiss my son's mother-in-law as we were leaving. Sounds sort-of normal, but her reaction was one of total retreat & hostility such that I just had to laugh it was so silly - yet I knew at that moment just how deep her feelings about me were - she could not hide it, she could not allow for me to be at a party with her as a normal person, the hurts were way too deep to let me 'escape' what other whites had done to her over her lifetime ! THAT is what is so difficult to get past ! America you have built a horrible history you may never be able to get over without multiple mixed marriages gradually teaching your children that the skin you label people with is just a very thin covering which nobody on the planet chose themselves !!!!!"
1069,"I'm over 60, am black, and have known hundreds if not thousands of black and biracial men. One thing that gets ignored in stories of biracial black/white people, especially men:

They always end up marrying women who aren't black. 

That does not just ""happen."" The internalized misogyny against black women and the desire for children with non-black features is a subject I'd like to see candidly explored for once. The number of black and mixed-race men who marry outside of their race is twice the number of other groups. I don't think that blacks should only marry blacks, but the social disadvantage black women still experience at the hands of blacks and other groups needs to be discussed."
1070,"Quite simply the greatest writing.  I can't remember reading anything more beautifully written.

1071,"Fantastic. Thomas Chatterton Williams is the antidote to so much of the writing/thinking/talking about race that goes on in politics and the media. By acknowledging genetics, history and individuality, he offers an escape route from the downward spiral of race discussion that we seem to be spinning through at the current moment. Writers such as Ta Nehisi Coates would have us believe that racial problems are indelible and that they permeate more than we think. I hope that Coates is wrong but I know that his thinking offers no path forward. In this piece, Williams acknowledges history and pain, offering an escape from both without ignoring either."
1072,"I?m a black woman. My grandfather looked White because his mother was Irish. When he walked to the store to buy ice cream for my mother, a neighbor warned my grandmother that a White man was buying her little girl treats! My grandfather was also part Narragansett and I don?t know about his Black ancestry, just that it was there someplace. He learned Polish from working on the docks with Polish immigrants and bought me vinyl polka records. I learned the polka and my little friend and I- two 8 year old black children danced the polka during polka celebrations at the ocean beach boardwalk. My dad?s great grandfather was a black man in North Carolina who had to bury his book in the ground and teach himself to read at night in North Carolina because it was illegal for him to learn to read and write. America. It?s complicated."
1073,"Commenters here would also appreciate Dorothy West's ""The Wedding,"" an artful book of fiction that has the same theme as this excellent article:  What makes a person black or white and why should it matter?

I am a 77-year-old white American woman who married a black man in (thankfully) liberal San Francisco in 1968.  I became a widow in 2011 after 42 years of marriage.  Our socio-economic family is similar to Mr. Williams':  Educated, professional, upper middle class on both sides.  We had a son and a daughter, both of whom are recognizably of mixed race.  My son's wife is mixed (white/Chinese) and my daughter's husband is a white Frenchman.  Their son, my only grandchild, looks completely white.  (When my daughter described his citizenship as Franco-American, I immediately thought of a can of spaghetti.)

We share many racial and family issues with Thomas Williams' family; but my husband and I dealt with them differently than he does:  Rather than analyze them, we ignored them and simply lived our lives as we wished.  I am well aware that living in California's liberal Bay Area has made that possible and am grateful that, by living in urban Europe and Los Angeles, respectively, my daughter and son enjoy the same freedoms of those more enlightened environments.   Happily, the world's future belongs to its cities, where racial mixing is already an accepted given."
1074,"In business school, a speaker defined a businessman as someone who provides a service and makes a profit. Someone who provides a service but does not make a profit is not a businessman, he is a philanthropist. Someone who makes a profit but does not provide a service is not a businessman either, he is a crook.

If having to make sure all your customers fit your stated business mode - i.e. pay back a loan next payday - will put you out of business, I would contend that you are not providing a service."
1075,"Elizabeth Warren couldn?t have written a better article.  I hope she also helps sponsor the T.G.P.B.

As the owner of a company, I have been wondering why, over the past 45 days, I received (unsolicited) offers to borrow money to ""grow my business"". Companies from San Diego to NYC have offered me funds at low (???) rates when clearly, had they looked into my D&B report, I didn't request money!

How could someone have been an honors student at Georgetown, majoring in international economics and finance and make a statement like that to a room full of people?  What was Mulvaney advocating I wondered?  Bankrupting your local hospital?

This Constitutional Republic did well for over 200 years without the CFPB.  It thrived without it actually.  I will not take lessons from Democrats on how to keep the housing market from crashing considering it was Democrats who created the scenario, insisting that every American needed to own their own home.  Policies enacted by Carter and later by Clinton led to the housing crisis.  Republican leadership gets blamed for it because Democrat policy blew up while Republicans were in office.  Obama always lied about having to clean up Bush's mess.  No, he was cleaning up his own party's mess.

Why does everyone think they need to turn to DC to fix the potholes on my street, or bad lending practices in Peoria, or payday loans in Pittsburgh?

That's the role of the State Government.

Always has been and always will be.

You can't rely on a ""Julia"" to be your spouse in government who will always be there to protect and defend you against all the dangers in the world. That's what your family, neighbors, mayors and state legislatures are for.

They're more responsive to the needs of their residents and more compassionate about making sure the residents of their state, county or town are well provided for.

This is Federalism in action..and nobody should be concerned that President Trump and his team are moving power away from DC and giving it  back to the States, Counties and towns where that power belongs.

Sad story..I flew into DC in 2010 and while the entire nation was suffering from the economy...I saw 16 tower cranes hovering over the DC skyline. 16 tower cranes leading  massive construction projects in a city that makes absolutely nothing. 

Taking those 16 tower cranes and moving them to 16 other cities where real Americans are working real jobs for real American companies is the right thing to do...and doing it now is the right time to do it."
1098,"Where are poor people going to borrow the money they need if they can't borrow from payday lenders?

1101,"The paucity of familiarity with civics and ethics in our country is staggering. It?s appears rife among some readers of the Times, too. I applaud those who?ve attempted to explain the law to those who don?t realize that purveyors of lipstick and those of rental housing operate under different sets of rules. Housing targeting toward white men is unlawful?with good reason. Targeting 18 year olds for lipstick is just that?lipstick advertising. I hope readers recognize that while housing, education, healthcare and jobs are not rights in the US, we have laws to prevent discrimination in these areas. What is most disturbing about this article is how long FB has gotten away with this. The laws banning discrimination are half a century old yet FB has engaged in actions that have a discriminatory impact and only now dealing with it...after being sued. FB?s ethical and civic breaches are legion. Why believe anything they say or do? The company has no conscience or responsibility and lawmakers? unwillingness or inability to reign in these companies and apply the law or pass new ones is something to consider as we head toward an election. We?re living in the Wild West of Internet business where the companies with the business are making the rules."
1102,"It would have been nice if this article had some actual examples of the sort of discrimination that actually occurred.  People commenting here are left to guess what will and won't be changed.  Generally speaking, if I must see an ad, wouldn't I want it to be a targeted ad?"
1103,"What is the difference between Internet advertising vs. newspaper or magazine ads that focus their wares on specific targets? If I were a fashion designer specializing in thousand dollar sweaters, I'd place my ad dollars in Vogue, not in the National Enquirer. If I had a three million dollar property for sale in NYC, I wouldn't place my ad in a small town's newspaper in Wyoming. I'm afraid where all of this control is leading is to a rigid oversight and total control of the Internet by some government entity. We're all upset with Facebook right now, but the government has more important things to worry about than targeted advertising. Don't let FB sell our information, but put the onus on the advertisers themselves to target their audiences."
1104,So Facebook is sounding more and more like a publisher. Aren't there rules for that?
1105,"Facebook says that they will have the changes in place by the end of the year.  And they agreed to pay $3 million.  I wonder how much money they make each month from these discriminatory ads...

As for why Facebook is liable for this (unlike, say, a telephone company that someone might use to  commit blackmail) is that they make selecting the algorithms that do the unlawful discriminatory targeting available to those placing the ads. Those algorithms are under Facebook?s control.  What Facebook agreed to was taking those options away from ad purchasers who are self identifying themselves as submitting the types of ads that were illegally discriminatory.  And those who did unlawfully use those algorithms, are still liable.  And those who fail to self identify as submitting unlawfully targeted ads by failing to self report will still be liable.  (And according to the article, many of the laws that cover this type of discriminatory practice are state laws, and Facebook and these types of companies are still liable under those state laws.)"
1106,"And how do we know Facebook is doing this?
Because Facebook is telling us they're doing it.
And what credible agency will examine the code(s) to confirm they function as advertised?  
There is none.
And who will provide the 'new data' that proves the code(s) are functioning as advertised?
Facebook will.
'Trump News' is news about Trump coming from Trump himself.
'Facebook News' is the same - news about Facebook coming from Facebook itself.
But 'Trump News' is recorded in the Media & Social Media as a matter of course - let's say 1-100 items a day?
'Facebook News' is a billion items per second recorded - and subsequently sold - only by Facebook.

1110,"As someone with a business that actually uses Facebook ads, the description here and from Sandberg is self-serving propaganda. Facebook is simply trying to weasel out of lawsuits and in the process punishing all advertisers regardless of whether there is actual bias or not. Now its becoming impossible to post an ad, and even more difficult to target a relevant audience. Without advertising Facebook has no business model, maybe they can start charging people membership fees - they will certainly lose advertisers if they keep this up. Instead of blanket proposals they should develop ways to identify bias without punishing everyone."
1111,We need to start blocking Facebook in countries outside the us.
1112,"Another symbolic ?victory? for ethic, gender and age groups! Now you will see more adds that you won?t click on and less adds that you would click on.

1113,"""The company said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year . . ."" It's only March. These ""changes"" can't be carried out for nine months??"

Does anyone really believe them? 
There is no chance that they will make any positive decision."
1115,"Targeting Facebook for the abuse of advertisers is ridiculous. Why not punish the companies that are actually targeting ads in violation of law?

If someone makes a threat over the phone should the government penalize Verizon? Facebook is a platform, not the originator of the content, nor a regulator. Though we seem to want them to be all of those and more."
1116,"Ad targeting is by definition discriminatory.

It is right there in the characterization - ""targeting"".

If I am placing an ad to sell or rent a condo in an adult community, what could can it possibly do to show the ad to teenagers or young adults? How annoying would be for those teenagers to see those ads?

Similarly, If I'm placing an ad for a job that requires medical license with board certification, what good would it do to show that to teens and early 20s adults - they could not possibly have the qualifications.

The interference with commerce and friction in the economy promoted by liberals is endless, I guess.

I just home my teenage daughter old does not try to rent a condo in an adult community or apply for a job requiring a medical board certification. After all, she will now see all those ads. Nice job."
1117,"Wow! It took a long time for such basic reforms. Even given the lawsuits. FB knew  they'd have to capitulate one day, but they stalled as long as possible. For a company with about $50 billion in revenue, a $5 million penalty is really going to make them change behavior."
1118,Nothing wrong with having rules in place for a limited number of categories but let?s not go overboard here as otherwise we will just be all bombarded with irrelevant ads and then Facebook will be blamed for being a spreader if spam as well. One reason I can?t stand watching most TV channels any longer is the constant interruption with totally irrelevant commercials. Not what I want to face online too.

1123,"Facebook is going to stop allowing advertisers in key categories to show their message only to people of a certain race, gender or age group.........Sooooo, in addition to selling our private info to any third parties who have the cash to buy it, Facebook has been practicing Institutional Racism, sexism and ageism....Up until NOW?.....And why am I not suprised?"

1127,A Facebook news tab?  What could go wrong?!
1128,"I think this development is good.  But most of the ?fake news? on Facebook is hidden in ads.  What we need is a content label with each ad, similar to the labeling requirements for food.  The content label would identify the true Source of the ad, and an ad would not be allowed to be published without the  Label.  The idea is that selling food without disclosing what it contains can make the consumer ill, or fat, or both, and publishing an ad without a content label can make consumers misinformed, stupid, radicalize them, etc."
1129,"Thank god. I've been a journalist for 21 years, and I've felt for the last few years that Facebook kept making the wrong decisions over how to handle the fake news on its site. Sorting fact from fiction can be a time-consuming task, and it's not something the average citizen has a ton of time to spend on. Having seasoned journalists who know how to sleuth out the truth sitting at the top, filtering out falsehoods from accurately reported stories, i.e. *doing their job*, will improve not only the experience on the platform but also our democracy. 

I saw how insidious even just seeing or hearing fake headlines can be during an incident regarding one of my best friends from Columbia Journalism School who grew up in a Muslim country where the news outlets are basically propaganda, and there isn't an independent press. Even she, someone trained to sort fact from fiction, one time said to me, OK, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I want to ask you, are you sure that 9/11 wasn't an inside job? That moment, I realized the power of propaganda and fake news -- it plants a seed of doubt in your mind, and that enables people to lose all grip on reality.

I know Kara Swisher has also been banging the drum for quite a while on how hiring experienced journalists could solve Facebook's problems, and since she's now an opinion columnist for the NYT, I'd love to see her take on this news."
1130,"""Facebook is now working to restore its reputation as a place where people can find trusted sources of information.""

HA!  No one should have ever gotten news from Facebook or anything like it.  That's why we have the NYT, WaPo and NPR for goodness sake."
1131,"Permitting someone else - anyone else - to ""curate your news stories"" is foolish beyond belief. The very idea beggars the imagination.

To be an informed citizen requires finding and regularly using a wide variety of reliable sources of information. This necessarily includes sources presenting points of view with which one may not agree. There's nothing new about this."
1132,"Har de har har.  Fox News has journalists, and those people do a pretty good job. The Wall Street Journal, too. But then they have their opinion sections that present a twisted, murdochian view of reality.

So Facebook plans to buy some journalists to pick through news.  Will it be like them hiring fact checkers who promote false reality as fact?

Facebook, if not shut down, should simply get out of pretending to present ""news"" at all.  Better still, their users should stop thinking they should get news from a social media site.

Facebook has shown little ability to police themselves as an organization funded entirely by ads driven by addicting their users - and real news isn't as addictive as sensationalist stories - true or not."
1133,"If readers are questioning the veracity of their information online,letting someone else decide what is ""right"" exacerbates the problem. Ultimately,one voluntarily chooses to use the platform. It is the individual's responsibility to distinguish truth, from verisimilitude. Most of us follow and interact with people similar to ourselves;so we are complicit in this ""bias."" It's only problematic when it tells us something we don't want to hear."
1134,"Good. News and information has always needed human ""curation."" I'm glad to see human judgement and perspective coming back. I'm sure it will be imperfect and limited, but it's a start."

1136,"?Our goal with the News Tab is to provide a personalized, highly relevant experience for people,? said Campbell Brown, Facebook?s head of news partnerships.WRONG! NEWS IS NOT PERSONAL! At it's best it is the truth we ALL need to know. 
News should NOT be curated! Professional journalists and editors present the important news from a non biased viewpoint irrespective of what readers want to read. It's not about what interests you it's about what we all need to know.
This is why we are so fractured as a society. We're all living in different worlds.
We'd all be better off if we went back to the days of the six o'clock and eleven o'clock tv news that everyone watched. Along with reputable newspapers you could buy on the newsstand. 
Online news is orwellian."

Long ago I stopped enjoying the endless politics, posts for lost cats, 'perfect' lives, and depressing news but I hung in there because, heaven forbid, ""you aren't on Facebook, seriously?!"".  It is a huge adjustment but one that will give me a little bit of my life back along with a sense of control that was lost the minute I logged into it."
1138,"I dont want my news curated. I want it edited with a high degree of impartiality. 

And I am very annoyed that as history would have it, Facebook arose at a time the NYTIMES had not yet got its digital platform organized.  And so sold news to facebook for distribution, so bringing forward false equivalencies and fake news. 

Only recently were we being told on these pages to ""blog with facebook"" and how unethical it was to assume a nom de plume."
1139,"They can add whatever they want, as long as I can find a way to hide it.  I have filters on my FB that allow me to see only what I want to see and very little extraneous content.  I hated the ""Trending"" section and it was the first thing I got rid of.  And I hope the day never comes when I depend on FB to show me the news.  I'll decide for myself what's important, and which news sources I trust. I do my own research as to the validity of what I'm reading."
1140,"No need to include women, right?

Typical study - extremely narrow band of subjects, all male."
1141,"PTSD causes the stress hormone cortisol to be released into the brain at a higher level than normal. An elevated level of cortisol is one identifiable norm of PTSD sufferers and survivors that can be easily detected in a blood test and demonstrably cannot be faked.

Furthermore PTSD causes structural changes in the brain that can be measured re the size of the amygdala, the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex as well as responses PTSD sufferers and survivors have to certain stress-inducing questions via brain scans. These brain changes are more marked in chronic complex PTSD sufferers and survivors, meaning since childhood.

Furthermore the majority of PTSD sufferers and survivors react positively to SSRIs and exhibit marked and improved responses before and after taking the SSRI and being stress tested before and after pill ingestion.

Furthermore a PTSD sufferer or survivor's anger and startle reflex are swift when triggered. For most PTSD sufferers and survivors, anger as the only reaction to stress is the norm.

Anybody can claim night sweats, inability to sleep, suicidal ideation. But to be able to fake the four items listed previously would be difficult.

The problem with PTSD treatment is caregivers do not understand how PTSD takes hold of a person and imprisons him in his own mind, where thoughts and feelings tend to cripple him into inaction, depression, feelings of powerlessness and worthlessness, and makes him lash out because of confused inarticulation."
1142,"Statistically speaking, the conclusions from this study seem fraudulent. 

First, the small sample selected -- 129 male combat veterans about 32 years old -- was divided into 2 groups based on a test that has false positives and false negatives. Since the sample was selected from another group that had been identified as depressed or drug abusers, the possibility of false negatives arises once again, so the sample may include some individuals it should not; I suspect with bias toward having PTSD.

Second, racial characteristics, socioeconomic aspects of childhood, location where language was first learned, height, weight and physical fitness were not considered; they all are relevant to speech analysis. So are the experimental conditions, including time of day. 

Third, 42526 voice features were analyzed with a combination of 18 distinguishing the 52 veterans identified as having PTSD from the rest of the dubious sample. The odds are near zero that a second similar sample would generate the same 18 features as significant on a blinded study, and that should have been done. I suspect that if an arbitrary group of 32 year old males were randomly divided into two groups and a similar learning analysis were done, the program would be able to find a small number of the 42500 possibilities that would distinguish the two groups.

I also worry about recognizing 29 and 34 year olds with PTSD, and from accidents as well as from intentionals -- of which this study says nothing."
1143,"""Using computerized voice analysis, a new study found 18 features of speech that identify markers of PTSD in veterans.""

This does not seem the best way to go. There may be some correlation found with predictive ability (though false positives can be a problem). Yet I believe there are much more direct, and accurate, ways to detect PTSD. These will actually require well-trained professionals to evaluate something about how badly afflicted people are by past trauma. Let's not put that task in the hands of computers just yet."
1144,"April 27, 2019

Great news .. every effort must be understood to study the minds of the military veterans adjusting to change. I myself a Vietnam Veteran clearly appreciates as my own experience was a struggle and thank goodness I was able to live well."
1145,"I have had a VA diagnosis of PTSD for about 20 years.  I also have had a VA diagnosis of Major Clinical Depression (MCD).  The psychiatrists tell me they are ""co-morbid"" which most dictionaries define simply as ""conditions existing at the same time.""  Personally, I believe my MCD came first ramping up gradually from when I was 18 to being full-blown when I was 20.  I am quite certain that my PTSD began very abruptly in Vietnam when I was 23.  After reading this article carefully, my reaction is an emphatic ""so what?""  Does the VA treating my MCD with antidepressants or the VA treating my PTSD with a benzodiazepine matter?  Take away either one, and my moods become worse.  I clearly remember that when I was first diagnosed after presenting at a VA ER )in crisis), the psychiatrist said, ""I can't tell if you have PTSD but there's no doubt you're severely depressed.""  So once again I ask ""so what?""  I was in a mental health crisis and I needed help. 

By the way, when I began treatment shortly after the above, I encountered former soldiers diagnosed with PTSD who described their test for PTSD as being strapped into a lie detector machine and exposed to a loud recording of machine guns and artillery firing.  How far we've come!"
1146,"Wow, this sounds great. But what if it gets out of hand? For instance, can we use it to analyze the speech patterns of those who someday might vote for Donald Trump so we can prevent that problem too?"
1147,"I am glad the long overdue (think WWI,II, Korea, Viet Nam) diagnostics are finally occurring for PTSD.  The treatment phase is also in dire need of attention including the use of ecstasy or Molly or MDMA, Johns Hopkins work on the use of  psilocybin mushrooms or the use of ketamine which is now more available as a treatment for depression.  Talk therapy has long been the only go to therapy with so little outcome."
1148,"It's a good thing only males' speech patterns were studied, since women never get PTSD. Especially women in the military. Right? 

And women's speech patterns are exactly like those of men anyhow, so why bother?"
1149,"Time to do this study with women and nonmilitary people, as well as people who are not native speakers of English..."
1150,"""...the algorithm was able to narrow down the 40,500 speech characteristics of a group of patients ? like the tension in the larynx and the timing in the flick in the tongue ? to just 18 relevant indicators that together could be used to diagnose PTSD. Based on those 18 speech clues, the algorithm was able to correctly identify patients with PTSD 89 percent of the time.""

""...disorders including insomnia and anxiety share many symptoms with PTSD [possibly including tone of speech]...

like breathing, speech tone varies throughout the day, and can be consciously manipulated or unconsciously adjusted based on environment.  ask a speech coach or actor."
1151,"I went to Vietnam in 1967 and was finally sent home in 1970. I even offered to re-enlist if I could stay in Vietnam for ""just one more extension."" '70 to mid-80s a blur of rages. Never was diagnosed but did hear a dozen times or more that I was just another of those drug addled crybabies who needed to grow up and stop whining. My wife is pretty sure I am still affected but much less now. I am awaiting the peace of the end..."
1152,"All this comes with a warning.  If you are having problems while you are in and you seek help, anything you tell the doctor will go straight to command who will quite happily take it to help formulate the charges against you.  Active duty military personnel are paid by their branch and their first loyalty is to the command - there is no such thing as patient-doctor confidentiality in the military.

If you are having problems, wait until you are out before addressing them.  Don't risk a bad-paper discharge.

Hang tight, brother."
1153,"At least superficially this article seems to describe a lack of range in modulation in speech as implicating a diagnosis of PTSD.

It would seem likely that this diminished range would at least in part depend on pre-morbid psychological substrate and comfort with the examination environment.

Medical diagnosis and care involves uncovering physiologic dysfunction which leads to impaired quality of life, and is very dependent on social expectations, pre-morbid function, and interaction with the health care system.  Publicizing an objective set of criteria - such as patterns of speech - without adequately identifying the context of the other factors leads to inappropriate utilization and rigid criteria and misdiagnosis and mistreatment.  It is like insisting that IQ tests diagnose level of intelligence.

Will this testing disqualify job applicants in the future who present flat responses because they are an ethnic minority being examined by majority staff.  Will someone anxious because of the parking situation fail to qualify for benefits.

When complex issues are reported, journalism needs to provide adequate context."
1154,"This feels like a genuine breakthrough which will lead to a better understanding for the military, yes, but also for all manifestations of chronic stress, including growing up in the ""battlefield"" of highly dysfunctional family dynamics.

I am encouraged for all who suffer from PTSD that the answers are coming. Great news."
1155,"In my experience as a consumer psychiatry and psychology are about 85% subjective and 15% objective.

Which may in fact be overly optimistic.

Although much more research is obviously going to be necessary... this diagnostic technology sounds extremely promising for the future.

The problem, based on a recent New Yorker article, may just be that Big Pharma is ending it's research and development into psycho-pharmaceuticals because they don't know how they work and therefore don't know what to look for.

Could this result in a future with improved diagnostics but a dearth of treatment option?"
1156,"Oh great.  Now to qualify for benefits, veterans will have to pass the lingo test?  

So much for research, fine.  But don?t hold soldiers who have put their life on the line for this country to this testing. Pay up the benefits they deserve and stop even considering making them pass this kind of testing.  I fear for fairness here."
1157,"The test is said to be 89% accurate, but that is between people pre-selected to be in only two groups: PTSD or not. Patients with other disorders that ""might complicate the study"" were removed beforehand. So it's really not clear what the accuracy of the test would be in a real-world situation where there is a mixture of patients with unknown conditions.

A more convincing design would include multiple classes of disorder, to determine the ability to discriminate PTSD when the true complexity of human conditions, and speech patterns, are in play."
1158,"A suggestion: A distinction is needed to identify PTSD. For me it is hippocampal atrophy where an emotional trauma causes the emotional storage mechanisms of the brain to fail.  Emotional trauma causes hippocampal atrophy. 

An ancillary condition is that there has been a movement within the military to facilitate hiring of discharged soldiers with hippocampal as police and fire personnel. This is a real problem. People with hippocampal atrophy do not mature emotionally. This is the cause of the high suicide rates in this population. After the  loss of emotional maturation the emptiness of life becomes overwhelming."
1159,"Or, we could just try decreasing incidence of trauma.   A world with reduced trauma could be very enjoyable and very productive.  
As in concussions,  one trauma makes an individual more susceptible to the next trauma.   Cumulative trauma increases damage.  If we could reduce childhood trauma,  adults could be much much more resilient when they experience trauma.
""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. ""  B. Franklin. 
Support for families would really reduce childhood trauma and the best and least expensive way would be to offer universally available and affordable family planning and birth control for every woman who wants it.   An unplanned child can throw a family into chaos, personally (think sleep deprivation) and economically (think $260 a week for child care in Portland Maine).    Chaos and stress increase the incidence of child abuse and/or neglect.  AND
THE CHILDREN SUFFER.    Make it easy for families to plan and you will reduce trauma.    Childhood trauma correlates with adult dysfunction and illness.   PREVENT, PREVENT, PREVENT."
1160,It sounds like this research is partly funded to try to reduce costs associated with the treatment of PTSD.
1161,"Since all subjects were men in the military, I?m curious to know how women and those with other forms of trauma (not combat-related) might compare. Let?s be careful of extrapolating one gender?s speech pattterns to everyone."

1163,"The failures of public support for education and the inevitable persistence of ISAs will spell the end of advancement in our nation's educational system.  

Humanity needs the freedom to follow what human minds are capable of imagining and investigating.  Worth in the academe is not measured by only who can profit from its works.  This is a barbaric application of free and open markets to education.  

Government support for education works because it doesn't pick winners and loosers.  Evolution works not because natural selection picks only the most dominant (""profitable"") individuals but because the diversity of the gene pool remains sufficiently varied, random, and heterogeneous.  

This sounds like a system only Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump could invent and champion."
1164,"A  MODEST PROPOSAL 

?Purdue and a few other universities have come up with I.S.A. programs that could point the way forward. They assess different rates and repayment durations depending on the borrower?s major. If you?re a chemical engineering major at Purdue, you enjoy better terms than if you study English: Under its I.S.A. schedule, chemical engineers are expected to repay $33,000 at the rate of about 8.5 percent of their income for seven years and four months, while for English majors it?s almost 15 percent for nine years and eight months.?

In a time of widespread institutional nit-wittedness, Purdue?s ?solution? to the student debt problem is still an outstanding instance of short-sighted stupidity. Why not just go all in, and educate STEM students and business majors  for free and pile the entire cost onto these generally useless liberal arts majors? Interest rates should be implemented in reverse order of probable income, of course, because divinity students, philosophy majors and other dabblers pose the highest risk of default. Excerpt of course for English majors who intend to become poets. These people should have a minimum of 20 years of indentured servitude and should thereafter be obliged to begin repaying their student debt, which will then include 20 years of compounded interest. This will also subtly encourage students to major in areas that help move our great nation forward and definitely trumps other less stringent proposals."

The New Jersey niece has her heart set on a very pricy private school in Manhattan despite being accepted by state schools.  She is currently applying for financial aid and student loans and will most likely end up in debt because of it, but she'll have that fancy name on her diploma should she graduate.  The Florida niece took advantage of the state's Bright Futures program, which will pay 100% of her tuition at the University of Central Florida and give her $300 a semester to use for other expenses.  She did have to take the SAT three times to get the score that the program requires, but she (and her mother, my sister) considered that to be a worthy effort."
1167,"Loans are only way to pay for college. Besides savings, some students can get free rides from certain corporations.  Some companies pay for the education of people they want to hire long term.  One student I know has this deal. He works part time in the summer for that company, but goes to school full time and the company pays his expenses.  

My son got two scholarships for law school, paid nothing at all the first year outside of living expenses.  The other two years, he had a 50% scholarship and used savings to pay for the remainder.  

His friend worked full time as a law clerk and went to law school at night. Both are successful attorneys in New Haven.

1168,"Growing up in a blue collar Brooklyn family I worked full time while in HS and immediately went into the work force after graduating.  There was no alternative.  When my youngest decided to go to Law School after college I was thrilled! A lawyer in the family!!  He graduated just in time for the economic meltdown (2008) with $225,000 in loans.  THE INTEREST ALONE WAS $1000 A MONTH.  Living in NYC, working as an attorney for the City, he'll never be able to pay back the loans without winning the lottery.  He would net more money if he had taken his HS diploma and went to work for the sanitation department.  Something is wrong with this story."
1169,"When I went to college, state funding of college was justified on the understanding that the entire population benefitted from an educated population. Private schools were very expensive, but we re an option for those who wanted and could afford them. The current system has gotten way out of whack. In my ideal world, tuition at state colleges and universities would be very low. We really need a national discussion of this issue."
1170,"Whether we stick with the present flawed system or ""reconsider education as a social good and make capitalists pay for it,"" somebody will always be paying the bills for higher education and they will expect a say in how their money is spent. Pretending that there is a non-judgmental money fountain is foolishness to the point of harm.

I don't know if ISAs are the best way to make decisions about higher education, but putting students into debt for an investment they barely understand is definitely not the best way."
1171,"This is a scary sequel to the previous NYT opinions entitled, ?Going to College should not be a Financial Albatross,? and ?The Student Debt Problem Is Worse Than We Imagined,?  with no guidance toward a solution.

The article takes aim at ISAs that pledge a percentage of the future income of an individual and argues in an alarmist tone that this innovation may undermine the fabric of our society! It sandbags a promising financial instrument (and in turn the global financial system) by contending that all borrowers should be treated the same at all times. Overall, the article asserts that private capital infusion into the student loan market can do no good to our society, and offers no solutions.

There is no panacea for the student debt crisis and systemic fixes would take decades to play out. Timely infusion of private capital increases the economic discipline and viability of the system. Private investors constitute less than 10% of the student loan market which is far less profitable than the unsecured personal lending; now we need innovative ways for them to share the societal risks and alleviate the increasing burden on the taxpayers and the parents. 

Let ISAs get funded by private capital ? the benefits far outweigh the social costs."
1172,"With so much debt getting an education in our nation, one would think we're a very educated society. Go figure!

Again! The goal of the few who already have most of the world's capital and are so desperate to continue growing that hoard of capital in a world where the masses have less and less capital, the only place the grifters have left to go is to persue the youngest, before they go into debt with college loans, mortgages, car loans, credit cards, health care, funeral and other debt induced activities of life. They're indebting humans from birth - or earlier if possible - hence they rely on a steady supply, an unsustainable ever increasing supply of humans to keep the capital rolling in - as planet Earth dies.

When one is in debt to the capitalists - those with all the capital - they own you. You have no power whatsoever - you've become a slave to destitute wages that end up paying the taxes for those at the top who do not pay taxes.

The capitalists have already wrung about as much capital out of society, our government and even from industry and corporations as they can - both to absurd levels of debt.

How do the Republican grifters expect this to turn out? What kind of $1.5 trillion worth of education teaches that more tax cuts are the answer?"
1173,"Information Technology can do good and/or bad.  For working people,  IT transforms ""employees"" paid for a full work day whether there is work to do or not, into ""independent contractors"" with NO benefits, who are paid at piece rates.  For people paying for college, IT enables income share agreements that can be benevolent.  But ISA's could easily become malevolent transforming new graduates into slaves to the persons who fund their education. 

Considering how in the past 40 years, IT has been used to reduce the wages and benefits and quality of life of high school graduates who go directly into the work force, Income Sharing Agreements have the potential to treat people paying for their college education even worse."

1176,"This is one of those situations that falls into the category of price gouging that runs rampant in the country today: college tuition, health care costs, rents, house prices, the list goes on.

Where this is different, however, is that working, responsible people who cannot afford to buy a house or rent adequate space-- a necessity if there ever was one-- are many times in this comment area told to get lost because they are not ""entitled"" to live where they want if they cannot pay. They should live on the street or a dangerous shelter. The house sellers and landlords are cheered for their ability to make money, capitalism at work! if people will pay it, I'll take it! supply and demand! is the refrain.

There is very little sympathy here for people who fall into these categories, but we're supposed to feel for people who feel ""entitled"" to go to an expensive school, voluntarily sign on for loans and then complain about the price? When there are other options available? What? 

We recently read a piece here in which a gal was whining about being rejected by ""almost"" all of the schools she applied to. She further made us all pearl clutch by saying that she couldn't possibly go to the local college because all of her friends got into the honors program there and she did not. What to do? Woe is me! This is the attitude that we're dealing with here. 

As long as people line up to pay, colleges will continue to increase tuition. It's the American way!"

Sadly, unlike Europe, Americans are too ignorant, or have been indoctrinated by years of a propaganda war financed by capitalism, into to believing that their system is not what it is, an evil, exploitative economic system that is leaving many enslaved by greed and a complete lack of morality. We have destroyed the future of many of our children and we will continue to do so. 

Greed is NOT good. Marx was right in so many ways."
1181,"How about we just halve the military budget, use the money make education free, and with the resulting economic boom you get from an educated citizenry that invents things and spends money, make healthcare free too?

Nah, that would make too much sense. So instead, let's create a situation where we literally sell equity in ourselves, and the moment that you decide to work less, you get sued by your ""equity investor"" for failing to work enough or retiring too early.

1184,"The student loan ""crisis"" is largely a government manufactured problem.  The gov controls the market.  It recklessly provides loans and grants (Pelll) to all comers.   When the government installed a lending regulatory regime (Gainful Employment), it did so only on for-profit schools and it quickly became clear that this was a religious targeting of for profits by the Obama admin & certain members of Congress and not a real attempt to reform higher ed.  The government intentionally favors non profits, limits competition (restrictions on new Title IV institutions), and doesn't hold the non profit community accountable for any form of loan repayment, job placement or graduation requirements.  The results? Limited competition allows schools to increase tuition, with no accountability to outcomes, schools can bring in unqualified students, load them debt, and let them fail - hence only 60% of students will graduate their 4 year degree in SIX years. Schools have no accountability in accreditation or lending for job placement.  Finally, every student is charged the same interest rate, regardless of the school quality, outcomes, and loan repayment rates.  To change the system, tie interest rates to degree/school outcomes - a 3rd tier school with a 25% graduation rate and a student loan default rate of 18% would mean that students could only borrow money at 18%.  Whereas a GA tech Comp science student would borrow money at 1%.   Schools would quickly adjust to outcomes"
1185,"You must keep all of this away from the private  business guys. They will find a way to make profits at everyones expense. The banks will charge extra, the politicians will cave in to the lobby money and it will be another con. 

Example, medicare has a 4% administration and Insurers 20%. Student loans thru banks charge 4-7% interest and they get the money for 2%. The private guys are sharks always  looking for new meat.

If we allow the junior colleges to be the screening and students go for free for two years and prove they can and will learn and be able to graduate then they should be eligible for a government NO INTEREST loan."
1186,"Newsflash - if you have to borrow tons of money to go to school find another way.  Where there's a will, there's a way.  A great work ethic is every bit as important as that degree that should not cost you $100K.  Go to community college.  Learn a trade.  You'll make a lot more more money in the long-run.  Start your own business."
1187,HUD finally doing something useful
1188,"The techniques & algorithms of targeted advertising are a great positive for advertisers & users alike.  I don't see ads for tampons or disposable diapers, among many other irrelevant (to me) products and I appreciate it a lot.  I wish there was something similar for television, so I could never see another insurance or pharmaceutical ad. Facebook's entire business model is taking the information you voluntarily provide and using it to target ads at you.  Anything you post on the site become's Facebook's to use to sell advertising to you. Some nefarious actors (Russians, racists) ln rare instances have figured out how to use your data to accomplish their purposes, others have used your data to decide whether or not to send you ads for feminine hygiene products or Medicare plans. Any discriminatory targeted ads appear to be inadvertent and Facebook is willing to make changes. But targeted advertising is here to stay. There is nothing you, I or HUD can do to stop it.  It is the wave of the future and only will become more refined as time marches forward. But there's a bigger story here that the MSM is missing. People wake up! Does anyone really believe that HUD is claiming that the poor, elderly, and/or people ""of color"" aren't being bombarded with enough ads? Anyone else feel like this might be politically motivated? I hate to be a skeptic but this feels more like Trump?s vendetta tour. HUD has begun the attacks against companies DJT doesn't like? Isn't this the real story?"
1189,"I used to work for the mortgage department of a bank. We would write a mortgage for a Wazoo from Betelgeuse if we thought the Wazoo would make the payments. On one hand the government gets mad if we don't make risky loans in neighborhoods where there are historically high default rates  or to people who have historically defaulted at very high rates.

On the other hand if we get these same loans off our hands by CDOing them, we are evil. Fannie and Freddie don't want them. The FHA knows no one is going to make the payments but they make the loans, knowing government will bail them out.

Why make the private sector make loans that won't be paid back and force us to raise rates on people who DO pay back and punish those who pay back for those who don't?

The banks have zero interest in passing up a chance to make money to discriminate. If a bank smells a dollar they will make a loan to a purple unicorn with green dots."

I am amazed at the fact that brown people stay in America.  It proves how terrible the entire world is - that they would stay in such a racist place."
1191,"Some here say that the issues of offering homes to those that can't afford them is wrong.   Others say all should see all ads.  Nonsense.  Advertising is based on targeting your audience. 

Others say that the housing bubble was caused by greedy banks that made loans to people that couldn't afford them.  That too is nonsense,  or at least an oversimplification of the last 50 years.  The bubble was caused by the government,  mostly due to liberal mandates that pushed deregulation.  Especially when in the 90s, Clinton declared everyone had the right to own a home and pushed Freddie and Fannie to loosen lending. 

If HUD continues this line if thinking and the law suit, liberals own the consequences.

Redlining is hideous and I applaud HUD, under Trump no less, for working to make Facebook and other internet services accountable. I hope, in the process, the discriminating advertisers also get their comeuppances!"
1194,"I think NYT is missing the point here. The real discrimination happens from the Lenders and Insurers and it is perfectly legal to do so. Capital One is a subprime credit card issuer, they will waste their mailings if they send them out to prime customers because none will respond. Progressive insurance is a auto insurer that targets high risk drivers, they are wasting their ads on people who have good driving records. FHA loans are for people who don't have enough money to make a reasonable down payment, does it matter if FHA attracts its core customer through the mortgage broker, mass mailings or the internet. You want to stop discrimination, you have to stop asking people their race! The biggest discrimination happens by American women who all want to date 6 ft plus males though only 15 % of American males are 6 ft plus. Why doesn't NYT stand behind short guys and go after match.com."

But what about their legal department? Don't they teach that stuff in law school any more. 

I am not even going to bother asking about common sense. Allowing advertisers to draw a red line that excludes ANY neighborhood for ANY type of ad is the dumbest policy ever. Allow them the opposite, even that is shaky but at least it has a percent in snail mail ad targeting."

Along with Facebook giving a platform to Russian military intelligence aka GRU, Russian domestic intelligence aka FSB and Russian foreign intelligence aka SVR to hack and meddle in American political campaigns and elections.

Now that we know that Facebook is credibly accused of  facilitating and perpetuating housing discrimination. What about Facebook's fair employment and hiring practices?

Fair housing was the last of the 1960'w civil rights legislative achievements.  When LBJ proposed it in January, 1966 it went into committee and died a bipartisan national opposition death. On April 4, 1998 Dr. King's murder led to massive urban black rebellion.  On April 11,1968 Lyndon Johnson signed the Fair Housing  Act into law.."

1204,"This is simply second order magical racism.
FB targets ads based on a number of characteristics independently of actually knowing the race of the targets. 
The fact that - in toto - those characteristics sum up to an imperfect racial category is where the magical thinking comes in.
Yes - different races identify differently when it comes to interests and activities but excluding targets based on income levels and other basic non-racialized data is common sense when you are trying to reach a particular target group. 
It is marketing 101.
This has significant implications for gender targeting as well - women generally drive more prudently that guys so they get lower auto insurance premiums - guess what - no more - it is now 'magically' sexist to differentiate in a number of states."
1205,Wonder what would happen if HUD looked at the advertising history of the Trump RE organization. Do we think they advertise to minorities?
1206,"Seems like HUD wants Fb's ""sensitive information"" real bad. I wonder why."
1207,"In order to discriminate against ""certain groups"" two things are necessary. Facebook must know who those groups are, and advertisers must be able to use that knowledge to target their ads. 

This brings up a larger problem with anti-discrimination efforts. You are allowed to discriminate based on some factors, but not others. You would not advertise Bentley autos to people with an annual income of 50k or less, and you would probably not advertise discount clothing to homeowners in Beverley Hills. Targeting ads based on income is legal. Similarly, you might not want to advertise black hair care products to white males.

So if Facebook knows your income level and skin color and allows advertisers to use this information to target their ads, its AIs have to distinguish between those ads for which discrimination is legal, like Bentley cars and black hair care products, from those for which it is not, like housing.

Housing and related financing seem to be the most fraught. Perhaps Facebook should teach its AIs to disallow certain types of sorting for this particular category. I'm sure that there are others too. If the AIs are really that capable, Facebook should be able to teach them to obey the law. 

AIs are a machine, and the law is clear that a machine's developers and owners can be held responsible for any damages it does. This discussion reinforces that notion."
1208,"In a related vein, it is high time federal agencies and states' attorneys general investigated American businesses' increasing reliance on algorithmic programs to select among job applicants.   

It's important to know whether the programming that decides which applications to forward to hiring managers has a disparate adverse impact on protected classes.    

Another issue is whether members of protected classes have equal access to the technology, and whether they have the know-how to game the system as effectively as applicants from more privileged backgrounds.  

After all, we know that high-status college applicants benefit from the advice of well-paid consultants.  It would not be at all surprising to find a nascent industry of job-application consultants who are familiar with the ins and outs of computerized job hunting and will share their expertise for a price."
1209,"The Fair Housing Act of 1968 is important and I'm glad to see some parts of our government still function in spite of the Republican effort to subvert it. The anti-trust laws are important too. We are way over due for some old fashioned trust busting monopoly shattering legislation and enforcement. Elizabeth Warren articulates the problems and solutions very well. Maybe too well. Americans don't like to think too much, hence the success of the advertising business. Which brings us back to Facebook."
1210,"Enough already about ""gig economy"" companies and how they're ""disrupting"" the economy. As we've seen plenty of already, way too often ""disrupting"" is code for knowingly crossing ethical and legal lines. Facebook is certainly one of the worst (and one of the largest), but there are a multitude of other similarly bad actors now. I'm not one to default to calling for more government regulations, but, in regard to Facebook and their ilk, we're already well past the point where the government should be stepping in to protect the interests of average Americans."
1211,"Here?s and idea- subject FB and other social media companies to the same regulatory standards and enforcement regime as our Banks because instead deposits they hold our personal information. In turn, management and the board can be fired and banned from the industry if they violate the laws or public interest. That will change behavior. Otherwise fines are a cost of doing business."

1213,"If a guy in a suit approaches you, and asks for direction it will feel entirely different than when a guy with his hoodie up asks the same question. We have a certain primal reaction to fear what is hidden behind a hoodie, and trust suits because of how fashion has dictated our perception of people. 

Our behaviour towards people changes depending on what they wear. To some people their fashion choices may not be a big problem, but especially in Amerika where many black people are still racially profiled and harassed on a daily basis, this becomes a bigger problem. The fear of the unknown will grow larger and in some cases this fear can become fatal for the wearer of the hoodie.

The hoodie is a garment that has a lot of history in it, and is worn by all different kinds of people everywhere. But you can?t marginalise the problems certain groups experience while wearing the same garment that a privileged person has never experienced."

As of 8:30 in the morning there are only 21 comments; the top rated comment has only eleven recommendations. This is despite the fact that this piece first appeared in the online edition on Thursday.

Since I tend to skim the Times' online home page two or three times a day, the implication is pretty strong that the Times never posted a prominent link to this article on its home page. (Nor, in fact, does the online version of the article yet reveal that it appears in today's print edition.)

The Times appears to have unintentionally deflected attention from a piece that they nonetheless deemed worthy of a fair amount of print real estate. Despite the fact that this was almost certainly not intentional, this nonetheless constitutes an example of what Professor Zuboff has called ""herding and nudging"". By showing (or, in this case, not showing) particular information and news, an online site has tremendous power (whether it realizes it or not) to shape what people see and how they see it.

I hope that the Times will consider publishing a prominent link to this article on its home page today."

How can a society control its criminal base without surveillance? Crooks love their anonymity, the freedom to be lost in the crowd: ""No one's watching so I'll just do my thing. Ain't America great!""

Maybe with better surveillance, we could have stopped many of the mass murderers cropping up across the land. Cops wear GoPro cameras now, and I wonder if citizens shouldn't.

I said that I was paranoid, but, truth be told, I don't trust my neighbor. Worse, he could ""snap"" at any time and begin building his bomb or planning his 15 minutes of fame. I realize that they are a fraction of the population, but that fraction can do a tremendous amount of damage. What were there -- 25? -- people directly involved in 9/11?

We will take ""one thin morsal"" more, over and over again. Boom."
1237,Several decades ago this type of surveillance would have been viewed as a science fiction nightmare. Now we see widespread acceptance. The goals of efficiency and optimizing a society will lead to this type of surveillance. To combat this we need to consider what is important for being human. The technology should be designed to enhance the values of humans. One of those values is privacy. Another is to be anonymous in public spaces. The kiosks should be a concern and should not be connected to corporations that are only interested in obtaining personal data for the purpose of making money. Smart cities are as much of a threat as smart homes. The battle against the surveillance capitalists must be fought and won if the US is to be a county based on democratic values.
1238,"The data are not only about privacy for individuals but about the power of whomever sits on the far side of the one way mirror. 

I am more worried about tech firms than terrorists. Tech is doing greater harm to the integrity of our institutions."
1239,If the unique identifier is my public wallet address and they drop some micro bitcoin in exchange for the data then it wouldn't feel so rapacious and invasive.
1240,The framers of the constitution used the census as a tracking device of sorts. I wonder how they would have viewed the current technology had it been available at the time
1241,We're going to far.  It sounds and feels like China.  When do the social scorecards come out?
1242,"I work in the smart cities space. I share Mr Green's concerns about privacy. I don't have a Facebook account, simply because I don't trust Facebook. But that doesn't mean I don't want to share any information about myself, especially if it's anonymized.

Privacy isn't a right. It's a social contract. We share information about ourselves to allow a society to exist. Sharing anonymous information with cities so they can provide better urban spaces, and safer environments for our children, and proper garbage collection is a pretty good use of anonymous data. If we can't at least do that, then what can we do?

The real question is trust. For this to work we have to trust businesses and public authorities to correctly handle the information we either intentionally or unintentionally provide. That means transparency. No one trusts businesses, and neither should they. Governments are wearing out their trustworthiness welcome. What we really need is transparent systems."
1243,"China is a vile dictatorship, or the equivalent. It's time to stop cozying up to it and take it down. The world must unite against China before it destroys all of us. China has done this before, expanding as an evil empire before collapsing into itself. Time for the collapse."
1244,"More fake news. The 1 million in detention rumor have been spreading by western media for 2 years yet not a single one have proven how that?s possible besides photos of a few building labeled as camp.

A simple calculation will show the Infrastructure necessary to keep 1 million housed, fed, educated, and put to work doesn?t exist in Xinjiang. Simply put, if the US needs close to 7000 prisons/jails just to house 2.3 million, how many do you think Xinjiang need?

If the media is willing to keep this obvious falsehood alive because of their bias against China, how many other less outrageous fake news do you think they will be willing to print?"
1245,"I know I know.  Whenever we report on a Chinese scientific achievement or a scientist, we must do it in the context of some political conspiracy or oppression-driven ulterior motive.  I got it.  I got it.  Next time just spare me the science and cut straight to the subtext of ""China: The Evil Empire"", alright?"
1246,"I thought from reconstructions of ancient DNA that we already could do more than this credits.

I am sure it is coming, from work being done in the US and Europe, no matter what China does.

It will be good for law enforcement here.

If China misuses it, that is just one more thing they misuse to maintain an authoritarian state.

However, we should remember that China has always had an authoritarian state. It is too much to assign one thought to 1.4 billion people, however we should note that other nations are entitled to choose their own systems of government, even if we would not want it here. 

They are also entitled to grow and change those systems at their own pace. 

They are also entitled to notice tradeoffs, such as the undoubted fact that for the first time in near two centuries, there is no mass starvation in China, and they are actually surging toward a first world economy.

I can respect such entitlements without wanting any such choices for my own country. But then, we are lucky to live here. Let's not mess it up. In fact, let's fix what we have recently messed up, rather than turning out eyes to the problems of other people in other places."
1247,"This just in so to speak, ""Facial recognition will be deployed at the top 20 U.S. airports by 2021 for ?100 percent of all international passengers"", including American citizens, according to an executive order issued by President Trump. ... It amounts to more 100 million passengers traveling on international flights out of the United States.""  The slippery slope, trading freedoms for safety."
1248,A good way to ensure Chinese government's money and resources are wasted with unproven technology
1249,"China also has a large scale well funded program to sequence and analyze millions of genomes to identify gene function and to search for the genetic components of talents and intelligence. Concurrently there is also a large scale animal husbandry program with private and public funding to produce improved farm animals using cloning and genetic engineering. Unlike the US and Europe, Chinese leaders have no ethical concerns that would override a practical eugenics program. They already practice large scale government population planning and control of reproduction using forced abortion and sterilization. It is very clear that China intends to put human genetic engineering into practice as soon as it is feasible."
1250,"Just remember, the West helped create this monster. We have only ourselves to blame."
1251,"From the article: ""In the long term, experts say, it may even be possible for the Communist government to feed images produced from a DNA sample into the mass surveillance and facial recognition systems that it is building, tightening its grip on society by improving its ability to track dissidents and protesters as well as criminals.""

In the US, we already use the GEDmatch database to catch criminals (and probably to track terrorists). According to Wiki. ""As of April 2019, GEDmatch had been used in at least 59 cold case arrests"". 

According to the Times (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/science/science-genetic-genealogy-study.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/science/science-genetic-genealogy-study.html</a>) ""60 percent of Americans of Northern European descent ? the primary group using these sites ? can be identified through such databases whether or not they?ve joined one themselves""

Fingerprints have for many years been used to identify people. This method of identification is being replaced by DNA databases. This is not technology that can be ""rolled back"" and the problem is certainly not specific to ""Communist governments"".

We should be MUCH more concerned about governments or individuals experimenting with genetic modification."
1252,"Whenever the NYT covers China, there is a slew of comments complaining that the US isn't perfect either. That is missing the point. Somehow, while the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, young Americans are becoming more isolationist. As a young Chinese, I try to share my perspectives with American friends, and the most common responses I get are ""Other people's problems are not my problems. I have my own problems!""

This attitude makes me sad. Like it or not, we're all in this world together. Complaining about American problems, to me feels like worrying about a cold when you have cancer. The US is not perfect, but the alternative - a unipolar world with China at its center - is terrifying. You all better stop taking your rights for granted!"
1253,"Brilliant reporting, extremely well researched - thank you. It seems with every human rights atrocity in authoritarian societies there is Western collusion - Facebook and its complicity in the Rohingya genocide, the the use of Israeli technology by the Saudis to track and kill Jamal Khashoggi, just 2 recent instances. Then, there is the massive theft of Western technology which makes these ethical crimes feasible. When it's not theft, it is willful selling of these technologies just for profit."
1254,"Let?s assume for a second that there is such a thing as an organized one-world government project. What then would be the job of the various bad countries located on the humanity divergence scale? Countries like China, North Korea, etc, where the individual is just a number. Their job would be to test questionable technology for future world-wide implementation. In other words, what you see there you will see here too ? it?s just a matter of time and your willingness to give your freedom away."
1255,"In summary, some Chinese geneticists worked with the Chinese police. They used American instruments and published papers in American journals. They used samples from police, which may or may not be donated with consent. 

So what? This is a prime example of the NYT creating an ominous article on China, filled with innuendo about ""Uighurs"", ""Ministry of Public Security"" or ""mass surveillance"", out of perfectly normal collaboration between researchers and their government."
1256,"I am a loyal Times readers and a moderate liberal, but I don't understand these trendy scares.  Between 2009 and 2016, the New York Times could not publish enough stories on the immoral and civilization destroying impact that drones represented and every story on technology in China or the Pentagon always weaved in some threatening new aspect of how UAVs was going to bring down civilization.  Not entirely sure why that wave came and went but now it is clear that facial recognition technology is the new boogie man.  Yes, every technology can be abused.  China already has the nuclear bomb and a million-man army, so not entirely sure science should come to a halt because of possible abuses of that technology.  Would Bell have stopped his work on the phone if the Times had reported on rumors of a future NSA or Edison throw out his work on the lightbulb because it will hang from every interrogation room?"
1257,Can't China just tattoo numbers on the inmates arms? -- I mean the ones that they're going to keep to do work . . .
1258,This is China?s Century!
1259,"Ethnic cleansing now being done with advanced technological tools, this needs to be condemned on all levels!"
1260,"I'm an ethnic Chinese and an immigrant.  I really hope people in the US can understand the nature of the Chinese regime. The regime is not a communist regime or a socialist regime (the level of inequality in China is as high as it is in the US). It's simply an authoritarian and fascist capitalist regime that doesn't care about human dignity. People in the US have to pay an enormous price--freedom, liberty, and dignity--to do business with China. American universities make money from Chinese students. Now on many university campuses in the US, you cannot talk about Xinjiang, Uighurs, or Hong Kong because nationalistic Chinese students and their consulate people are everywhere. They take pictures and even videotape at will on campus. The Chinese government and people boycott not only the NBA but many businesses and individuals whose speech ""harms"" their feelings. Academic articles published in the west are censored by the Chinese government. An NYU professor who grew up in China censors for the Chinese government.  Is this what we want in the US? Wake up Americans!

1261,"DNA phenotyping should be illegal period on an international level. We have a right to privacy of our bodies, our faces, our health history. This is the nuclear bomb of privacy. It is wrong."
1262,"Communist China hasn't been around so long that is should be regarded with such FINALITY.  The West, with higher ideals and ambitions for mankind, has to wake up and handle the mesmeric power the Chinese try to impose on all they encounter and work to possess."
1263,Does anyone read 1984 anymore?
1264,"With a million or more ethnic Uighurs and others from predominantly Muslim minority groups swept up in detentions across Xinjiang, officials in Tumxuk have gathered blood samples from hundreds of Uighurs ? part of a mass DNA collection effort dogged by questions about consent and how the data will be used.

...But given the crackdown in Xinjiang, experts on ethics in science worry that China is building a tool that could be used to justify and intensify racial profiling and other state discrimination against Uighurs...

****
Dogged? Dogged by questions? The Chinese government, a totalitarian government ruled by a dictatoral power? Sorry. These types are not ""dogged"" but those doing the dogging, in this case, dogging  its citizens by extracting DNA samples."
1265,"Reminds me of old photos showing Nazi ""scientists"" using callipers, tape measures and other instruments to measure the heads and faces of people.  They diligently recorded all this data to codify the characteristics which they thought could determine Jewish ancestry and other types of humans who they deemed criminal or degenerate.  Ostensibly to ""purify"" the population, a concept which could conceivably convince some dimwits of a good intention.  In reality, the choices they made regarding supposed degenerates really didn't matter even to the Nazis.  Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals - none of thatv really mattered - Any identifiable group would do as targets - as long as their oppression and murders would  serve to keep the bulk of the population in fearful obedience.  The gloss of ""science"" provided some degree of cover.  The white-coated technicians with their harmless measuring tools would not have dared to question the purposes to which all this window-dressing was being put."
1266,"This is so, so wrong"
1267,"This is a perverse update of last century's concentration camps - adding brain washing, mind and body control, turning humans into mere labor-cattle-bots. Does anyone really think many of these Muslim human beings will be allowed to go free afterwards to testify to the world of the Chinese atrocities they experienced? Many will be disappeared just as the Nazis tried to disappear the Jews - the demolition of Uighur buildings (like, depressingly ironic, bulldozed Palestinian homes) are preparations to disappear them.

Science fiction horror films and stories warning us of how innocuous seeming technology can be used against a human dismantles the claim that since you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear from data harvesters, surveillance, etc. One only needs to watch China and their subjugation of entire populations, territories, cultures, to see why technology for good can and IS being abused against millions of humans that ""have done nothing wrong.""

Most Americans qualify as dissidents, protesters and criminals in a trump world. Indeed, he insults and smears mostly Americans and not a single Russian. Go figure!

""the Chinese government is exploiting the openness of the international scientific [AND BUSINESS] community ... for questionable purposes."" Indeed, the world has empowered a global menace - the Chinese central government of thugs - over billions of people inside and outside of China."
1268,"Same ""rounding everyone up"" provincial quotas that occurred in Russia under Stalin that killed millions not even accused of a crime. The same calculated mass societal terrorism that sent the message, an 'education' to fear the state ... to the effect that if state is ruthless and human rights denying enough to throw 100's of thousands of innocents into gulags, well, just imagine what horrors the state will inflict on whole families or communities if one member actually dares to disagree with the one party Chinese dictatorship. Unfortunately this category of societal terrorism is all too familiar to most of us now. Resurgent Neo-Marxists in the USA and Europe use a very similar tactic of vague-generalized false accusations against out of favor identity groups (whites, males etc) of racism, sexual assault, Anti-Semitism, xenophobia, the 'intolerance' of using ""threatening"" prohibited words recently declared criminal memes to get people fired from their jobs. To destroy their lives and reputations in order to terrorize citizen majorities into silence - to force all into submission to the new Marxist central-planning Utopia of our global 1%s that has Corporate State-Capitalistic ideological characteristics."
1269,"Having toured Urumqi and Kashgar this summer, I was appalled by the security presence and the effort to eradicate the culture.  Last time I was in China it felt like they had the corner on building cranes - this time it was razor wire.  

Our guide told us the government had just announced that all children - age 3 and up would be attending boarding school- coming home only on weekends.  Including city kids.  All studies in Chinese, no more Uigar option.  When will we ever learn that this kind of repression breeds terrorism and dysfunction?"
1270,"It appears that some elements of the CCP are leaking documents because there's an emerging power struggle with Xi. That's the real story, if the dissension over Hong Kong, trade and the redistribution of wealth is gaining traction. Wealthy and well-educated Chinese are turning against Xi and some high up in the party appear to sympathize."
1271,"The only reason I regret that this article was published is that it provides a playbook that Trump, Stephen Miller and others of their tyrannical determination to Make America White Again"" can profitably draw from. I'm surprised Trump hasn't publically admitted his admiration for Xi Jinping, another strong man with low morals."
1272,"As a Chinese who lives in Germany, I really appreciate the New York Times.Your team did a tremendous good job!As a Han Chinese who lived in Communist China for more than 20 years, I can imagine how the Uyghurs suffered from all Xi has done. He did everything far from democracy und modern-day civilization with brutal methods, not only to the Chinese people but to the whole mankind. Just imagine a Mao Zedong with no-limited money and power, alongside with all the dictators in the world. If  We don't do anything, this planet will be destroyed totally with WWII looks like just a joke."
1273,"Interestingly, confidential government documents in China should have red seals and words that indicate its level of sensitivity on every page. But these documents have no such marks. It seems that these documents are not considered to be sensitive and may be circulated among every government official. In my understanding, NYT exaggerated the importance of these documents. This may explain why NYT only makes a few pieces public."
1274,"I believe that the Chinese government has implemented the necessary procedures to control terrorism and extremism. As a Chinese, I support the government. Western governments should learn from it, not bomb or kill so many Muslims."
1275,"In US, religious extremists are terrorists.  In China, religious extremists are human rights and freedoms fighters.  Why?

Simply ask people on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai and they may genuinely tell you this is the right way.  Why?

20-30 years ago, most Chinese young people believe US is a great country and brilliant teacher that will guide China to a prosperous future with freedom and democracy.  Nowadays, most Chinese young people view US as a withered and angry empire.  Why?"
1276,Supposedly all 400 pages are available. This article only shows four. Where's the rest of them?
1277,"I am an Uyghur woman studied and worked abroad. It?s been almost three years I lost contact with my families and friends. My brother was detained in concentration camps since 2016,Dec simply because his relatives traveled aboard. My passport was not  renewed, therefore I had to seek asylum abroad.. During these years, I saw and heard so many Uyghur?s sad stories in China and also outside China. Thinking about never seeing my relatives and friends forever tear my heart. All of these  affected my pure soul and I suffered severe depression and now I lost motivation of doing anything. I sincerely hope that the world knows the truth about Chinese government  faster and take measurements faster.  I believe Chinese government is a wicked, failed government and soon it will collapse.I hope Chinese people themselves wake up and know the reality about their government and make correct thinking and decisions as humans. Otherwise they themselves suffer strongly soon, all the developments they think they made will explode as a bubble. The Chinese government did not realize how severely they attacked the soul of Uyghurs, also Tibet, Kazak people (etc) even including good thinking Chinese people, by doing all these. The hatred they created are unmeasurable. Wicked Chinese Government, Stop your evil hand towards Uyghurs, Tibets, Kazaks, HongKong people... Also stop your evil hand towards World."
1278,"My comment to the people in the free world. Communism ruling was proven as a threat to the whole world. From mainland China, I am ashamed of CCP ruling and my people who support CCP. Communism ruling is a disease and is spreading around the world. Think of NBA, Nike and Blizzard. They are all cases CCP lay their claws on western companies. Shoot the people?s republic of China and long live democracy!!! Fight back people!"
1279,"The Han-dominated, totalitarian Communist Party of China, which  runs the puppet Peoples Republic of China governent  has decided that Carl Schmitt, the ""Crown Jurist of the Third Reich"" (""Kronjurist des Dritten Reiches"") is its favorite Western Jurist. Its genocidist actions in Tibet and Xinjiang show it is on the same road as Carl Schmitt's favorite totalitarian, Dolphy. Arrests, torture, and camps.  Its ""Belt and Road"" initiative could be understood to be a ""belt around the throat of liberty and road to the concentration camps for the survivors"" making it now the greatest threat to human freedom on the planet. But they do good poverty relief and seem to be ""green""."
1280,"I feel frustrated and desperate.
I think most of the people commenting solely  about their feeling of ?disgust and angry? are not really trying to think about this very complex and controversial situation.
As what has been mentioned in this article  (through very briefly), the policy towards Xinjiang is not always the same, and an unarguably truth is, the massacres really did happened, way before the concentration policies. I myself have seen some of the gruesome, horrifying results of the 2009 Ürümqi massacre. Those were all massacre directly towards Han Chinese residents in the area. And as the article mentioned, those were happened during the policy of only using economical strategy.
I?m absolutely not trying to argue that because of what have happened, what the gov is doing now is right ? I think what they are doing is the opposite of solving the problem, but the question is, so what is the solution here. I have no idea.
(Sorry for my terrible English btw)"
1281,"So I?ve been looking for all the atrocities mentioned by readers in these documents and I?ve turned up nothing. No torture, no killing, no starvation, not even forced labor. Sounds like they?ve rounded up people to cleanse their ideologies and instill party loyalty. 

Compared with the US way to deal with terrorism (invading multiple countries and bombing them back to the Stone Age), this seems far more humane and effective."
1282,"I was very disturbed to read this article. I will begin immediately my own personal boycott not only of Chinese manufactured goods whenever possible, but also begin to do the same with the products of western companies doing business with China. Ready to discard my smart cell phone I was pleased to learn that it was manufactured in Vietnam. I do not care what the affect to my bank account my personal boycott will be."
1283,"Is anyone genuinely surprised at this revelation? It's typical of communism, the kissing cousin of socialism. Insofar as China specifically, what's happening now merely mimics Mao's Great Leap forward and the rape of Tibet. Under communism, the party owns your mind and body, totally. Dissent is not tolerated. Dissent with the party agenda results in reeducation, imprisonment and execution.  Beyond this, we saw the samething in post-Revolution Russia, Fidel's Cuba, Pol Pot's Cambodia and North Korea to name a few. The emphasis is on political purity and Lord help you if you don't measure up. Being politically pure requires that your god is the party - there is no room for any other god. Something similar seems to be happening in the US regarding political purity and it's frankly scary. Under the 1st Amendment we all have a right to express our views. I've notice that conservatives will grudgingly allow liberals to express their thoughts. However, liberals (not all of them) will shout down conservatives and not let them speak. UC at Berkeley in particular comes to mind. If the conservative speaker still insists on speaking, masked members of Antifa often appear on the scene using violence to suppress  the speaker's 1st Amendment rights. Anyone who doesn't find that scary is a fool."
1284,"Why did NYT start with hundreds of words of Mr. Xi justifying the internment of Uyghers? Then, most of the NYT Picks in the comment section is in support of the internment. The well-documented human rights abuses are numerous including torture, starvation diets, constant surveillance, detention without due process, forced labor, etc. The article should have started with the human rights abuses, not with the rationalization for them."
1285,"As a Chinese, I would really want to read all the docs. Furthermore, the translation of the documents is really bad, please post in full, so that the documents can be read in total."
1286,"So, present day Americans enjoying the spoils of Native American genocide and African enslavement are the arbiters of freedom. It?s easy to find fault in another countries system but when a people refuse to acknowledge and make amends for their own sins they simply come across as hypocritical."
1287,"Chinese government are mass murderers and despots.  It is a shame that their system is allowed to exist in today's day and age as they are worse than Hussein and Gaddafi.  They will show no mercy to not only opposition, but to any one whom they think is a potential threat to their forever quest to expand and consolidate their power. What they are doing to Uighur population is not only reprehensible and vile, but it shows the world how they will treat everyone else who falls under their jurisdiction once they perfect the technology. We should be  more than just concerned. It is a shame that United States is just watching the protesters in Hong Kong, they will be murdered, just as mercilessly as the students in Tiananmen Square. Most favorite nations status?!"
1288,Guess we know what's in store for Hong Kong now.
1289,"Interesting to see how US action/inaction in Afghanistan influences Beijing. This is why we need our seasoned, professional diplomats and military officers to pay attention to and give advice on these complex issues."
1290,"China has chosen a path to deal with terrorism that does not involve invading multiple countries, causing the deaths of 500,000 people and the displacement of 2 million.

American hypocrisy, ignorance and incompetence know no bounds."
1291,"I am a citizen of PRC (not by my choice) and a Han Chinese. I am so ashamed of the crimes committed by the CPC regime and the widespread racism towards Uighur Muslims. I think that we Han people are now bearing a similar sin to the Aryans, for what is happening in Xinjiang right now has no difference to the crimes committed by the Nazis to Jewish people. They are equally sinister and disgusting. I would sincerely apologize to the Uighurs who are going through this ordeal. And the CPC dictators and their supporters definitely do not represent we Han people. Real Han people, those with a conscience, definitely stand with the Uighurs and feel guilty for the crimes committed by their people."
1292,"I lived and worked in China for 13 years and spent as much time as possible in Xinjiang, despite Beijing's dissatisfaction and obstacles, where I made a number of Uighur friends, several of which have fled to the U.S. or Europe, others who've in the past decade been imprisoned or who have simply disappeared. Twenty years ago, one could see that the Uighurs faced a bleak future of supression and containment. Today, however, an energized Empire of Lies appears to have been inspired by ""roundups"" and concentration camps. Its lapankas lead to mind-numbing; minding-numbing propaganda, propaganda fed to kidnapped and sequestered Uighur children; the disappearance of aged Uighur men; the torture of Uighur adults and sexual abuse of Uighur women; and last but not least of course, summary executions of Uighurs detained in concentration camps. And that's in a nutshell. Now's the time for leaders in our political and business cultures to put China's massive ""roundup"" into its proper historical context."
1293,"Corporate policy has been - for many years by my experience  - a policy of 'burn the bridges', forcing customers to buy new products rather than fixing the existing item(s). 

Initial CAD - computer assisted design - systems users were the large companies that could afford to spend millions for the product.  

Our product was never thoroughly tested and we experienced a flood of problem reports after each new software revision release.

Companies still rely upon the customers to test their products. 

The ultimate of customer 'push-back' came over 25 years ago when a customer insisted upon seeing the open software problem reports and get the problems fixed before it would sign the contract.  I was the project manager for that project initiated by the corporate vice president of sales, resulting in weekly conference calls to the customer updating our progress. 

The same policy exists today, but it encompasses a far greater range of customers as the product is now available to small businesses.

In general, unless it has changed, software developers are not trained in problem-solving techniques, which, by my experience, involve an in-depth knowledge of the lowest level computer instructions and operating system architecture, especially when these elements can have flaws."

And, I agree, it hasn't been the best decade in tech. Lots of mistakes by the industry. But there are many really smart people working on complex and important issues. I am grateful for their contributions to our world."
1296,"Tech has absolutely not lost its way. It is on the same path it has always been on, the same path as any corporation: maximize profits! In the process it quite naturally spent lots of money peddling snake oil to the masses, claims about how tech would inherently be a force for good.

Like any other tool, tech can be used to help and to hurt.  Encouraged by tech corporation public relations, people understandably self-deluded into not believing reality, namely that the bad guys are as smart as the good guys and often more motivated.

So now we have elections that can be hacked, a nuclear command and control structure dependent on chips made in China with whatever clandestine control code Xi Jinping mandates, an electric grid that can be taken down, TEXTing drivers killing more people than 9/11 terrorists, and unemployment for suicide bombers, as drones and self-driving cars make their occupation redundant.

And we now have the ""democratization of truth"" compliments of the internet: i.e. ""alternative facts."" The internet: a place where anybody can say anything, where editing for quality and verifiability is dismissed as ""so 20th century.""

Yes, let's all hail the tech mantra, ""Disruption = Progress"", the concept that brought us Donald Trump as President."

1301,"I've commented a lot, but I have just one more thought.  Whatever problems there are with internet technology are the same for anything that you try to make broadly available to the masses.  Read any list of consumer reviews, and you often find a majority complaints come from people who don't know that they're doing. We have almost ubiquitous computing technology use but a dearth of tech savviness.  

Many of the complaints seem to be akin to blaming auto manufacturers for not preventing bad or irresponsible drivers from getting behind the wheel.  Is it really up to them?  In fact, there's an  even more compelling case for taking car companies to task--they are, after all, peddling their wares to millions of people who should not ever be trusted with public or their own personal safety.  But that would be ludicrous.  In that light, the outrage against tech companies is a little weird.  It's hardly ever directly life or death, certainly not to the extent of the daily carnage on our roads, and on net contributes to our safety and well being in many ways we take for granted.  Remember this the next time you're not hopelessly lost somewhere or need a ride in an emergency.

1305,"This is an excellent piece, but I cannot help but feel that the oral history of tech in the preceding decade is not complete without mentioning the compelling and tragic story of Aaron Swartz. Mr. Swartz was young but influential person who acted in crowds where technology and politics intersect. Mr. Swartz inspired numerous other well known luminaries yet tragically took his own life when a heavy-handed prosecutor sought to imprison him for much of his life. Aaron Swartz was a gifted young man who used his gifts to make the Internet and the world a better place. His story is not only one in which tech which lost its way, but one of how American Justice lost its way. It strikes me as particularly relevant in these times."
1306,"""Tech"" means different things to different people - wrong to use one label to cover disparite companies.

Seems emblematic of a story of how tech failed us in this decade, doesn't it? I viewed this story on a Mac running the Firefox browser. I use a bunch of adblockers and javascript filters. If I was using the Times app on an iPad, I imagine everything in this story would work as promised. 

Technologically speaking, the internet seems to work best for people who trust the most.  It works poorly for the skeptic. A devout skeptic has to practically be a security guru and IT pro to use the internet. 

Interestingly, a news organization probably functions best when run by skeptics. 

Congratulations on publishing the most ironic story of the 2010s!"
1309,"Tech used to be the hardware that made the net run. Servers, routers, repeaters, and all the other parts that actually move the bits around were new and exciting, and better ones were being developed all the time.

Now that stuff is a commodity that most people rent from Amazon, or that the services they use rent from Amazon. Now days, the focus is on the software platforms and the applications that drive the markets. It's not just the social media platforms, it's the customer contact software that your dentist uses to wish you a happy birthday, and the database that Facebook uses to track your browsing habits and sell to advertisers. It's the interconnected bank software that runs the ATM, does the job of 20 tellers, and lets you look at your statements online (I hope you have good security!).

What can all that tech do for humans, and how can it be monitized? That's what tech means today, unlike 20 years ago when we were developing the hardware to support all that software."
1310,"Funny, because tech was previously about automation, of reducing human input to gain the same or more output.

Once tech was used for mass human communications, where human ideas could easily be spread, where tech was not for automation but for social media, we discovered that human input is often a source of conflict and control."
1311,"There should be a square here for the electronic coup d'etat that took place.  Dissent, opinion and public discourse once reigned in the engineering environment for software, hardware and chips.  Today that is gone.  Any dissent in form of inventions, standards and methods is now fully scrutinized within the engineering and software professions.  Dissent is primarily managed by academic and professional blackballing and other punitive measures.  That is, in every country fortunate enough to have the technological means to do so.

The current situation that we find ourselves in is indistinguishable from a military coup d'etat.  It is the first coup d'etat secured through the internet of things."
1312,"Only suckers believed the hype.  Suckers still do.  Not every opinion has equal value.  Being electronically connected isn?t community.  Spending endless time staring at devices doesn?t improve productivity.   The internet and smartphones are simply selling distraction, disassociation, misinformation, a false sense of agency.   Children can barely socialize, the physical world goes largely ignored, the rabble have been roused.   But a few clever conmen get to be billionaires."

Major publishers and newspapers hate technology.  We get it.  It's toppling the regional, national, and international media oligopolies.  But these were the aberrations in the first place.  

The free press was always envisioned to be truly democratic.  It was always about the government against some little pamphleteer, not some media conglomerate with more money and power than may of the entities it reports on.  

I can't say that social media propaganda to an intelligent person is any more of threat in terms of warping our perceptions of reality than other media.  Writing and all creative media are and will always be unreal.   At least now I get to hear and read about many different perspectives.  I find myself learning a lot by disagreeing.

I agree that we should worry about privacy, but the business model for all this is built on marketing, and we collectively chose that.  It's really a symptom of the existence of marketing and our desire to get things for free.  I'm not blaming tech companies for that."

1319,"This story resonates with me.

We lived in Brooklyn for many years and belonged to a well-known black civic organization. My husband is a chef and one year they asked my husband to cater a small event. When I gave them a quote, they turned us down flat because they thought our price was too high -- ""Chicken only costs 59 cents a pound!"" -- was how they put it.  Instead they solicited food donations and we contributed.
We opened our restaurant in 2008 and established a group of regulars that included several customers who politely, yet insistently shared THEIR vision for OUR restaurant. ""You should do this, not that; more of this, less of that."" No one worked in food and beverage. Instead they thought unconsciously or not, that these two black business owners needed help. Never once did they ask about our 30 years experience or business plan. To presume that you have the right to offer unsolicited advice, and that we should be grateful for your recommendations is insulting.  Now, could there be other explanations for these behaviors that aren't white privilege in action? Anything's possible.

The challenge for black business owners and the chef profiled here is the perception of value. Customers evaluate the merits of our product or service. The intersection of race, ambition, wealth and fame contribute to unconscious bias: stereotypes in favor of or against a person or group as compared to another.

Bias doesn't make us bad. It makes us human. New behaviors are possible."
1320,"Kwame Onwuachi, come and visit Hyde Park in Boston sometime. We have so many restaurants from these same roots and they are not fancy or expensive (yet). Good people, great food."
1321,Good food is good food. Not black or white. Coming back from failure is the best guide of what type of a person one is. Congrats.
1322,"I am embarrassed that this article appeared in the New York Times. The chef and the author appear to have no basic understanding of the business of restaurants. Per the chef, ""If I were more experienced in business, if I had asked about the budget in the beginning,? he said. ?We were on our way to making strides. But instead of asking the right questions, I was excited in the moment.? What was the partner's comment on this statement? Or did you even bother to ask?  No investor / partner just throws their hands up in the air and dissolves the business, usually unless the inexperienced chef's ego or ignorance has caused the project to fail financially.  Playing with other people's money is easy; creating a real business based upon more than magazine awards is difficult.  I wish this young chef well, but his attempted direction of this article warns that he is much more concerned with the PR than with the success of the business. It is a simple formula for a hotel to hire in a chef with PR potential, as they have nothing to lose when they dissolve the agreement and move on to another chef. I'd bet $100 that this young cook has yet to create a simple P&L for his kitchen.  Of all the talented, successful chefs in America, it is baffling why the NYT would dedicate so much space to a chef that has only failed thus far.  It is even sadder for all of those deserving chefs that will never appear in these pages, including those in this article that warranted only a brief mention."
1323,"Hmmm. I'm not sure the author of this piece read the WaPo review of Shaw Bijou.( As a former resident of DC, I did and recall the fanfare and expectations surrounding its opening.) That critic didn't ""pan"" the restaurant, but praised it and the chef and his cooking in many ways. 
Ultimately though, the critic and his three guests felt that the experience was not worth nearly $2,000 with wine, tax, and tip. And, they were all hungry after the meal. Even a meal for four at Citronelle, run by Michel Richard, was less than half that, and we didn't leave hungry."
1324,"There's a reason that new restaurants, especially a one-off, have a high failure rate in their first one-to-three years. One of the biggest problems for new restaurants is that people open them, oft times at the urging of friends and others, because they are ""great cooks"" or they ""love to cook and make people happy.""  Consequently they get caught up in the idea and become trapped by their own and others' enthusiasm.  

The reason to start a business, such as opening a restaurant, is because You Want to Run a Successful Business.  That's a whole different orientation and skill set than being a ""great cook.""  If you ""just"" want to cook or the most important thing to you is cooking, go work for someone who wants to run a successful business. You do what you do best, they do what they do best.  That's a point too often missed in training programs."
1325,"I?m glad he?s bounced back, but I found it rather ludicrous that someone would hand a blank check to open a multi-million dollar restaurant to someone with so little experience. A couple of stints at high end restaurants doesn?t mean you?re in any way ready to lead a large scale project. And being seen on Top Chef adds absolutely nothing to one?s skill set. No surprise the restaurant didn?t last."
1326,"?There is a ceiling for chefs of color that I want to change,? Mr. Onwuachi said. ?I can give people opportunities to move up.? 

""He is well aware that few black chefs have been granted such recognition. For years, he said, it irritated him that only white men were hailed as the culinary greats whose restaurants young cooks would have to pass through in order to succeed.""

While I agree with much of what Mr. Onwuachi states, I must point out that a trend has been increasing in which black chefs have been recognized with the prestigious James Beard award, notably Edouardo Jordan (Best new Restaurant - Junebaby in Seattle), Dolester Miles, Rodney Scott, and Bryant Terry - just to name a few.

Granted, the progress has been barely a trickle for a long time, and a change of mindset has been long overdue.  However, I cannot help but think major cracks in ""the ceiling for chefs of color"" have begun and will continue to grow and expand and flourish.

I applaud the efforts and commitment of Mr. Onwuachi in wanting to ""give people opportunities to move up.?

I wish him continued success in his career and sincerely hope he finds the fulfillment, enrichment and inner peace in every endeavor his pursues."

Georgetown University never actually sold any eslaved African Americans... since the University itself never enslaved anyone.  Thank you for not referring to them as ""slaves,"" but even the linked article is careful to state that the Society of Jesus, who ran the school, were the ones who enslaved and later sold the 272.  Georgetown was a third party beneficiary to the transaction, as were other entities then owned by the Society of Jesus.

That being said, I'm happy to read of Mr. Onwuachi's return, and may just give his restaurant a try to see just how much of his Trini grandparent's influence has survived the transition into his kitchen."

1342,"One of the problems in our American political system (at least federally) is that smaller parties have no voice and find it pretty much impossible to gain any kind of power whatsoever.  One of the problems in Israel's political system seems to be that smaller parties, often with far-from-mainstream ideas and policy agendas, sometimes can wield undue power beyond their numbers.    Democracy -- there is no perfect way to do it, but of all the other known choices, it's the only way to do it."
1343,"I have been to Israel many times and I am familiar with the situation there.

Netanyahu is the *best* candidate for the Israelis given their very difficult situation caused by the Palestinians, in 2006, electing Hamas to lead them.  Hamas, according to the EU, US, and Israel a terrorist organization, does not recognize Israel and thus there cannot possible be any talks of given the Palestinians their own country 70 years after they first turned it down.

After the 2006 election, a civil war ensured between Hamas and Fatah with many, many deaths.

There were supposed to be elections in 2010, nearly a decade ago, but they have not occurred.  To this day, Hamas and Fatah do not get along.

Hamas, instead of helping their own people, have used concrete and  funds intended for constructing homes for building tunnels and for purchasing missiles to shoot into Israel.

As a result of the missiles and the tunnels into Israel, 3 wars between Hamas/Gaza and Israel have ensued with many deaths.

Netanyahu has been working with Fatah (which still governs the West Bank) to help to improve the economy there.

It would be wonderful if the Arab Parties in Israel insisted on new elections among the Palestinians, encouraging them to elect a government that recognizes Israel, but they have not done that.  They could also criticize Palestinian leadership who make unreasonable demands such as not allowing Israel to maintain troops in the Jordan Valley for protection."
1344,"The author goes back in time to cite political precedent -- the ""good old days"" as it were -- but the fact remains that with their bus bombings in the mid-1990s inside Israel, the Palestinians themselves have accomplished what no Israeli leader could:  the disappearance inside Israel of a Jewish Israeli constituency for the Palestinians.  

There is no traditional left in Israel, as there was before the 1987 intifadah, when Palestinians used to visit the Tel Aviv beaches on the weekends.  It is now up to the Palestinians to convince Israeli voters that they want to coexist peacefully.  Certainly Mr. Abbas has done nothing to help. 

As for the prospect of Mr. Netanyahu inviting into his coalition the new extremist party:  If one examines very carefully Netanyahu's record over the last 23 years, one will see that he has managed to contain what outside observers regard as Israeli ""extremism"" by co-opting those parties that the West finds noxious.  Two quick examples come to mind: his administration's support at times over the years for court challenges against the creation of new, non-contiguous settlements in the West Bank, and the absence, thus far, of legislation ""annexing"" the West Bank to Israel.    

In short, Netanyahu's ""embrace"" of a small extremist party does not translate into wholesale changes in government policy, for the simple reason that the vast majority of Israelis are reasonably conservative."
1345,Netanyahu is an extremist. What do you call someone even further to the right?
1346,"Netanyahou is a corrput world class clown and his right wing Likud party and religious fanatics are as dangerous as any Islamic Terrorist.

The United States is on the wrong side of justice and history by continuing to subsidize Israel. Until the Israelies throw Netanyahou in jail and stop letting religious whack jobs dictate the policies of the country, Israel is doomed for destruction."
1347,"A note to the Author: When colonialist show up in your country and take over your country they will never trust you as you are the indigenous. You are what they want and you are what they can never be; Especially when they can still see and feel the day they're grated what is not theirs. They have displaced you and will not deal with you as an equal. For example the behavior of the founders of the USA towards the Native Americans, the founders of Canada vs. the Native population of Canada, the Australians vs, the Native Australians, the New Zealanders vs the Native New Zealanders, White South Africans, South Americans vs Native Populations. Europeans wherever they have gone to colonize have never had treaties or even equitable treaties with the Native populations. The European Founding Colonialists and Occupiers never migrate to integrate with the local population but instead to move to install a European Colony which economically ties back to the motherland or motherlands. It will take at least another 100 -200 years to get the situation normalized (whatever that may look like)"
1348,Trump  represents the people of the US and Netanyahu Israel.  Both I would argue are bad hombres.  Trump is/was a one term leader.  Netanyahu  get elected continuously so shame on the people of Israel.
1349,"Shameful to allow anyone advocating ethnic cleansing, of any kind, to hold any public office in Israel or anywhere else.  That includes in Gaza or the Palestinian Territories or any future Palestinian State.  

It is a travesty that people on America's Left don't condemn Palestinian calls or plans for or attempts at ethnic cleansing.  (I do not hear such a call in the author's piece, nor do I know of Arab members of the Knesset who do.)

That said, Christians living in Israel and Palestinian areas might remember to turn the other cheek and similar of Jesus' teachings; Muslims in Israel and Palestinian areas might remember that Allah inscribed it that at least parts of those areas ""are for the Jews;"" and that Allah made us all different so that we could know one another, not so we could hate one another; and Jews in Israel and the relative few in settlements or in the holy-to-Jews small cities of Shechem (aka Nablus) and Hebron might remember that they were once strangers...   And all 3 religions have similar versions of the Golden Rule, which should also determine how people of non-Abrahamic faiths living among you ought be treated. 

And to the religious monotheists among you, remember: there is One, whatever you call the One, it's the same One.  Honor that."
1350,"Believe it or not Rabbi Kahane's real target were Jews who he thought were getting a little too complacent in the post-Holocaust era.  Nothing provoked Kahane more  than Jewish laziness in not recognizing Jews  were still in danger from a hostile world which was disappointed that Hitler didn't ""finish the job."".  The establishment of Israel did nothing but provoke more  gentile anger. The ugly incident in Congress this week only proved Kahane was right.  Established Democratic leaders couldn't appease Ilhan Omar fast enough.  Meet the new face of the Democratic party.  If Ilhan Omar doesn't make Jews wake up nothing will."
1351,"The Israeli election commission is also now in the process of banning Muslim candidates, entire parties. They mean to wipe out that element of the elective body.

It has existed for many years, even though marginalized in that nobody will accept them in any coalition nor in any government. Still, they were there. Now they are being driven out.

That is at least as consequential as running such overt racists to fill their seat."
1352,"""The April 9 election is an opportunity for the left to present a moral alternative and take a stand for democracy.""

I agree.

When do you think the same might be stated for the Hamas government which rules half the Palestinians in Gaza and

When do you think the same might be state for the other half of the Palestinians ruled by Fatah, from Ramallah?"
1353,"Bibi mirrors Trump in his consistency.  In the 1980's, when he held a mid-level diplomatic position, he called for the Palestinians to be caged, separated from the Jews.  One can understand some racist feelings after the Holocaust, but leadership has responsibility to what is best for the nation, today and the future.  Israel is better by having Palestinians within its border, it gives a perspective that must be considered if there is to be anything but perpetual war.  Good luck to Mr. Odeh and may the electorate return to its senses in the coming election."
1354,"As a left wing Zionist I agree and find this article inspiring. The party I support, Merez, should support this.  

However I believe this concept would work that much better if it  included a platform advocating a Three State solution: Israel, Palestine, and Greater Jerusalem. Greater Jerusalem would comprise all the citizens  ( Moslems  and Jews) who prefer religious government to Democractic government. 

Both the religions have much more in common with each other than they have with a secular population - and the secular populations have more in common with each other than they have with their religious wings."
1355,"Israel seemed to work reasonably well when the Labor Party was in control. I think from a liberal American perspective it has been all downhill since the Likud Party has taken over. If people who are followers of Kahane become part of the majority coalition then that takes right wing extremism in Israeli politics to a new level. It has been reported that Donald Trump is popular among Jewish Israeli citizens. If that isn't a head scratcher. I think if somehow the left in Israel could get back on track there might be a decent chance for a peace agreement and the two-state solution. The last thing Israel needs is people in government supporting ethnic cleansing. I hope Israel moves to the left, takes down that wall, stops building any more settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and somehow finds a partner on the Palestinian side to negotiate with to end this tragic conflict."
1356,"Big surprise: Netanyahu puts Netanyahu above all else, not just everybody else!!"
1357,"Netanyahu is a thug, much like Trump and MBS. Israel needs new leadership. Now."
1358,So why isn't this article labeled anti semitic ? Tom Friedman care to chime in?
1359,So sad and yet boring to read the same blind support for Israel. I?m not at all surprised that not one of these comments talks about US interests which are not synonymous with Israel?s.  The Palestinians blew it and we knew at the time it would take a generation to get a peace process moving again.  That time has not yet come. It will but not before Netanyahu is a memory.
1360,"It's becoming clearer that Israel will never consent to political union with the Palestinians, or the existence of an independent Palestinian state with true Sovereignty. Thus, I think the Palestinians best hope is just to survive and reproduce at a faster rate than the Jews. The area between the River and the Sea now is populated by about 50% Jews and 50% Palestinians--although some demographers claim the Palestinians already constitute the majority. In a century, Jewish Israelis will be a minority on the brink of a new diaspora or inferior citizenship. And climate change will radically diminish the value of land in the southern Levant."
1361,"Extremism on the part of either Arabs or Israelis is harmful.  I remember Kahane. He advocated what amounted to terrorism. 

On my last trip to Israel, I was blessed to meet a  number of Arab-Israelis.  They were rightly proud of their place in their country. All asked me why we would tolerate Trump as a candidate. I can only imagine their dismay when he became president; my own dismay was huge and still is.  

Sensible people who want to compromise can do so.  I encourage that approach in both America and Israel."
1362,"To the esteemed author:

Your phrasing of your national identity is new to me.  Could you shed some light on how and why you choose to describe yourself and others as a ""Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel"" and not, say, as a ""Palestinian-Arab-Israeli"" or an ""Arab Israeli"" or an ""Israeli Arab of Palestinian heritage"" or a number of other possible combinations of the three central aspects of your national/political identity?

This is a sincere question asked in respect by someone who has pondered how to describe myself (other than as a curious person who is Jewish) and is interested in how others come to know and describe themselves."
1363,"Congress just passed a bill condemning hate in supposedly all forms. Numerous Republicans voted against it, wondering, I suppose, ""Is this some kind of trick?"" What I wonder is if this resolution is construed to include Semitic nationalism."
1364,"Netanyahu not an extremist? Isn't Kahane the definition of a Jewish supremacist? Is being against these extremists anti-Semitic too?

It's clear for every Arab dedicated to the destruction of Israel there are, Jews dedicated to the destruction of Palestine. The difference is that Israel has been actively destroying and demolishing Palestine out of existence, contrary to international law.  Indefinite occupation? No, just a long one, hoping the international community will not notice the disappearance as they demolish entire communities. Perhaps if one can't exist, neither should exist. Is that anti-Zionistic or just plain fair?

If right-wing members in the Knesset walked out on Kahane, real Republicans should walk out on trump's SOTU. But it's different today. The right's gone off the edge of extremism, becoming anti-Constitutional (stealing SCOTUS seats, the presidency and votes in NC, GA, etc). Likud's no different now.

It is about power AND the Benjamins. How to explain the affinity between Netanyahu and trump (who calls neo-Nazis fine people) and Orban. The West Bank is real estate - theirs for the taking as they please. Trump's doing the same on the north bank of Rio Grande - stealing land for HIS wall. Corrupt racists of a feather flock together.

""shared Jewish-Arab struggle for peace, equality and democracy."" It's hard to believe that this isn't the overwhelming majority in Israel. Then one would think a majority of voters in our country would've elected our leader."
1365,"""In the 1990s, support from parties representing Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel saved the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin from collapse. While they didn?t officially join the coalition, two Arab and Arab-Jewish parties created an outside bloc that allowed Rabin to remain prime minister in exchange for an unprecedented role in policymaking. This was one of the most effective periods in the history of Arab parties in the Knesset.""

So in the most effective period in the history of Arab parties in the Knesset, these parties did not join the coalition with other moderate Jewish Israeli parties.  What would you expect now in the least effective period and how would you make it better?  My recommendations to you are to try harder and make some new pronouncements to encourage your brethren in Gaza and the occupied areas to make concessions and peace!  Why not start by publicly saying you are willing to accept the offer presented by Rabin and Barak with some minor specified changes."

1367,"Biological men are not women. They can have elective surgery, they can take hormones, they can grow breasts, they can remove their genitals, but they are not women. And biological men do not belong in women's changing rooms, women's clinics, women's prisons, and women's sports."
1368,"It's worth mentioning, again, that it is not possible to change one's sex. We are a sexually dimorphic species. Some humans create small motile gametes and others large immotile gametes.   We call those who produce small gametes male and large gametes female. We could call them peach pies and skateboards but it would still take one of each to reproduce. No amount of surgery, hormones, sparkly dresses, or short hair can change the kinds of gametes our sexed bodies produce. 

Gender is behavior, specifically a hierarchy of behaviors in which some are ranked as superior and called masculine, and others are ranked inferior and called feminine. Radical feminists want to abolish gender because we believe that there are no behaviors that are limited to one sex or the other. Wearing a dress doesn't make a boy a girl, and wearing trousers doesn't make a girl a boy. No surgery is required to change behavior, just the will to do so. 

Trans Rights Activists conflate the words sex and gender because they know that sex can't be changed, and they want to con people in believing it can. They especially want to con vulnerable young people into thinking their unhappiness their bodies has to do with some mystical girl brain in a boy body that can be solved by mutilating surgery and life time of taking hormones. We need to support gender non-conforming children by assuring them that they are fine just the way they are, that their bodies are fine just the way they are."
1369,"By all means, if you identify with stereotypical characteristics of the opposite gender, then live that freely, however when transwomen begin to encroach on the rights of my female patients, who are in need of a safe space, far from male bodies, this presents a problem in the care and rights of the women I tend to. 95% of the transwomen coming into the womens shelter have  recently been released from prison - and ALL have assault charges, more often than not against women. 
 The women I care for in the homeless women's shelter are victims of rape and domestic violence  enacted on to them by men, with strong male bodies who have preyed on these women and traumatized these women.  My patients and their needs  to feel safe are secondary to  the ""rights"" of transwomen.  I have never however seen a transman insist on staying in a male shelter- because of the obvious inherent danger.
Men still run the show.  Women's most basic needs for safety still appears to be secondary to whims of men."

When you force girls to allow biological males into their sports you are the authoritarian.  When you force women to accept biological males in their bathrooms you are the authoritarian.  When you crate laws punishing those who misgender, you are the authoritarian. When you force taxpayers to pay for sex transition surgery, you are the authoritarian."
1374,"It's the anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge in WW2, where the Nazis counterattacked the Allies weak points.  I'm thinking also of the Charge of the Light Brigade.  A full frontal assault on the bathroom salient will likely lead to a major defeat, and perhaps a counterassault that will push LBGTQ troops back even further.   Harry the flanks (equal rights in general), avoid the strongpoint, and allow resources to be diverted to strong attacks on the enemy's vulnerabilities (health care, slow wage growth, wealth transfers to the wealthy, corruption and self dealing, etc.)."
1375,"The article does not attempt to draw a distinction between what we used to think of as transsexual (MTF, FTM), and gender as a spectrum. I suspect acceptance of ?traditional? trans people is far ahead of acceptance of non-binary gender."
1376,"""I think that however much Democrats may want to win, we must not lose sight of our moral compass ? especially in times like this. The commitment to protecting the rights, equality, and well-being of everyone ? not just those with power, wealth, or privilege ? is absolutely central.""

1379,"Like many Americans I regard the coming election as one of great import.  Also, perhaps like many Americans, I view the transgender movement as a complex, multifaceted, and arguably unique amalgam of civil and human rights issues.  To regard the trajectory of the latter through the desired outcome for the former, however, gives an already fraught political process more weight than it can possibly carry.  Complicated social realities can't just be tailored to political expediency.  Whoever ends up in the White House will effect, but not determine, the entire course of the whole world and all its diverse inhabitants.  Case in point: the process of educating the general public as to a relatively new set of issues, continuing public conversations regarding sexuality and gender in this area, as well as debating important relevant topics regarding public space and resources, began well before this election and will continue long after it is over.  Ditto global climate change -- so don't relativize the importance of one in relationship to the other.  Above all: please don't play into the growing panic regarding the upcoming primaries and election to the extent that all decisions must be made in relationship projected presidential outcomes.  The world will not end in 2020 no matter who is in the White House."
1380,"Democrats and their identity groups truly are their own worst enemy. Men are tired of being the last consideration, always, logic be darned.

In the 70s, women proclaimed loudly that they didn't need any protection from men, and anyone who suggested otherwise could go straight to Hades. In the 90s, women proclaimed that they play tennis and soccer just as well as men and are entitled to the same rewards (e.g. Wimbledon)--but only as long as  the relative safety of gender segregation for women was continued.

Women proclaim that they should be able to join men's sports and men's clubs, but that their sports and their clubs must be rigidly protected from outsiders. Judge Constance Baker Motley, a female, ruled that women must be allowed into male locker rooms. And women are always, in movies, shown disabling and killing six men at a time who dare to threaten them, all while not messing their mascara.

Enough of this balderdash. Women and trans people have not yet worked out the inherent contradictions of their own ideologies, which are treated as the only thing worthy of consideration. Men have desires, aims and powers of which Democratic identity groups know not.

And that is why Trump will be reelected, and one of the reasons why I probably will vote for him."
1381,"Trump knows that the more the debate is about transgender rights, as opposed to health care in general, and civil rights in general, the better his chances of being re-elected. Edsall took the bait."
1382,"For myself, as a trans woman, this illustrates why I am not a Democrat.  I will, of course, vote for whoever they run against Trump.  I think its safe to assume that fewer Democrats actively wish me harm than do the white, cis-het, bigots, who would even consider voting for Trump.  That said, I am not so naive that I think all Democrats, or even all liberal Democrats, are my allies."
1383,"Transgenderism is like other body dysmorphic disorders, and all who suffer gender dysphoria should be treated with compassion. But ""compassion"" should not lead us toward the amputation of healthy body parts or spending taxpayer funds to sterilize or alter our children's bodies. The entire Democratic party is being cowed and intimidated by a few gender studies professors from Columbia and Berkeley and a small army of trans activists on Twitter. 

Men with uteruses, really? Men in women's domestic violence shelters and prisons and sporting events on the basis of how they feel about themselves?

People are at each others' throats, the planet is cooking, corporations are getting away with murder, the institutional structure of the US is crumbling, right wing authoritarianism is on the march world wide, and what do liberals want?  A national conversation.  

Ms Thomasson and others, you can't have ANY conversation or anything else unless you win!  Win first, *then* get out your moral high horse.  Otherwise, just keep rearranging the deck chairs.  

And anyone who thinks that the next president is going to solve racism, sexism, homophobia, and every other ism is out of their minds.  Yes, a non-white non-male president of the US is going to undo thousands of years of human nature.  Sure.  OK.

1389,"Transgenders have no special rights except in very narrowly tailored circumstances. For example, someone should not be fired *because* they are transgender. Beyond that, enough of focusing on 0.2% of the population."
1390,"Part of the fundamental difficulty with so called ""trans rights"" is that they are not asking for the same rights enjoyed by non-trans individuals but rather for unique treatment to be classified as a ""right."" For example, non-trans people do not currently have the right to have the military or Medicaid/Medicare pay for cosmetic treatments for body dysphoria no matter how deeply held the dysphoria. 

For example, breast augmentation for women or leg lengthening for men who want to be taller are cosmetic procedures those individuals must pay for themselves - even if these perceived body dysphorias cause psychological distress for the people holding them. 

Now this doesn't mean that Democrats should totally turn their backs on the trans community. It just means that they should focus on things like employment discrimination instead of trying to extend unique ""rights"" that have no parallel in the non-trans population."
1391,"RIGHTS do not impose obligations upon others.

The right to marry is absolute between the two individuals involved, but just as attorneys may refuse certain clients, so may clergy, bakers, venues, photographers, etc.

1392,"Since when does the racial make-up of a company's workforce relate to the local (racial) demographic!? That is one of the more ridiculous arguments I have heard on this topic for some time. In that respect, I would be interested to find out the percentage is of individuals in management who were native to Portland before being employed by ADIDAS, and in turn, which, ones were subsequently relocated to Portland after. Lastly, I hope someone takes a closer look at their hiring practices, something I myself did not exactly have a particularly positive experience with...and I'm pretty sure I'm not that only person of colour who has said that."
1393,"This isn't news to a lot of us minorities.  We see it all the time.
  
On one of the radio stations I like, I realized about a year ago there were literally no people of color as DJs.  They're listed on the website but to find them on air, you'd most likely have to wake up at 4 a.m. on the first Sunday morning of the month.

There's certainly a part of me that appreciates the work towards diversity but there's also a cynical part that says it's a PR thing."
1394,This is pretty funny. Is basketball a racist sports because there are so few whites? Is football? We all agree that those skewed numbers are due to merit. Have you ever considered that Adidas?s skewed numbers are due to merit as well?
1395,"When I first got into competitive sports and became conscious of name brands in clothing in the 1970s, Adidas was THE name in both athletic footwear and in fashionable sneakers.  I have gone through phases of liking Nike when I idolized Steve Prefontaine and when Adidas changed their running shoe emphasis from fast, competitive runners to shoes for 9 minute per mile plodders (nothing against those people, but as a 5:30-6:00 minute, lightweight, competitive runner, their shoes were no longer tailored for me), but I had been coming back to Adidas in recent years as their shoes again became more adapted to my style of running, such as the higher performance Boost shoes and also because I felt that associating with Adidas brought me back to my roots of when I first became a competitive athlete.  Lately, however, as mentioned in the article, Adidas has aligned itself with the black hip hop culture, and I have distanced myself from the brand, as I no longer feel that it represents my identity.  Brands can't be all things to all people, and Adidas needs to decide what demographic they wish to pursue (Nike also has this problem of trying to make a shoe for everybody, resulting in a huge numbering of offerings with no cohesive identity)."
1396,Adidas North America should relocate to either New York or Los Angeles. Simply being next to Nike in Portland is a disadvantage.
1397,"Truth is, these companies are not made for us, hence we need to build our own.

At its core, adidas is designed to maintain a whites only club in its c-suites and beyond, and I don?t blame them ? the company was built by white people.

All of these companies sell diversity and none of them practice it ? hence it?s sad to see Beyoncé & Kanye sign with them, because they have enough market cachet to build companies that can rival an adidas or a Nike, companies that can hire talented black kids.

This diversity issue will never end, until my people start building their own companies and hiring their own ? sure it?s going to be hard, because the system (worldwide) is built to prevent black kids from truly flourishing, but we need to fight through the red tape.

Adidas is doing what Adidas has been doing since its inception, and that?s ensuring that their own people win ? my black brothers and sisters have to trace their blueprint and do the same.

Beyond black and white, everybody is just trying to survive and adidas is using their playbook to ensure survival... a white workforce got them this far after all.

We need a black owned adidas to do the same, and it will happen one day.

With Love."
1398,"Everything everyone knows about how capitalism operates in the US suggests that companies are not going to ignore pools of qualified workers because they don't like them.   If they can get good workers for cheap, they will hire them.   Over in the IT world, they'll take rather unprepossessing Indians with thick accents because they don't care what they look like or how they talk.   Employers believe they will churn out acceptable code for a low salary, so they're in.

Employers obviously have unfavorable opinions of black workers.   They will pay lip service to diversity, but they're not going to put their businesses on the line.    They will continue to go with what has worked in the past, because in an intensely competitive business world, they think this will lead to success.   The need to get the work done quickly and cheaply overrides every other consideration."
1399,"Reading some of these comments, I am amazed.   I agree with the comments from Brian.  No employee deserves to be minimized or experience discrimination.  If the employees are not qualified, they should not have the job, but they do not deserve to be treated less than.  Additionally, while Oregon has a low diversity rate,  I would bet that many of the leaders from Adidas are not from Oregon.  Having any number of minorities with no power who feel minimized is like not having them at all.   If Adidas made an effort, I know plenty of talented, qualified men and women of color who would jump at a chance to move to Oregon and work for the company."
1400,"There is so much ore to diversity then just diversity of race ? diversity of thought, backgrounds, and inclusion for all will bring great returns.  Great ideas, creativity, and transformation for the future are best done with diversity of thought."
1401,"To offer the opinion that diversification need not entail unqualified people is reductive, and frankly, patronizing. 

No one who is advocating for a more diverse and inclusive workforce is demanding that unqualified people be hired simply on the basis of their race. The pernicious effect of racism is the fact that, and it's pointed to in this article, even once you have your foot in the door and are ostensibly part of the team, you can be discredited solely on the basis of your race. 

Reducing diversity to analysis of representation on some kind of a per-capita basis perpetuates the idea that once you clear some threshold of minorities in an organization, that it's somehow magically 'diverse'. Statistics can be elucidating, but don't get to the core issue. The real question to be interrogated here is whether or not Adidas has fostered an environment where people of color are treated like children, to be seen but not be heard. On the basis of this reporting, it seems plain that is the case and they need to rectify that mentality."
1402,Diversification doesn?t mean that one should ever hire the unqualified.
1403,"I think this is an important and well written article, but I feel like it should be more about Portland lacking in opportunities for African Americans than just Adidas. Additionally, any recruitment effort outside of Portland is going to be stymied by its high cost-of-living, especially ,compared to areas with large African-American populations. Portland and my city, Seattle, would benefit substantially by creating more opportunities to attract a wider range of diversity into our cities but none of that is possible unless people have a place to live."
1404,"""Adidas has built much of its name ? and sales ? through its association with black superstars""

Huh?

It started in Germany in the 1920's and their most iconic product is the Samba soccer shoe."
1405,"Something like 2% of Oregon is Black. If anything they are over-represented at the company. Should the company make efforts to relocate black employees. Is this a sign of discrimination against white, Asian, or Hispanic employees. Maybe considering their target audience, they should bring in more black executives but that is with reason. Does favoring black executives disfavor other minorities?"
1406,"Adidas consistently sells empty platitudes while ignoring reality. Their basketball player line of athletic wear has sizes to 3XL but no tall sizes.  No tall sizes in basketball gear, are they serious???  I guess they?re selling to fantasy basketball players, certainly not to actual ones."
1407,"All three of the companies mentioned (Adidas, Nike, Under Armour) are based in Portland, which is the whitest major city in the country. Until Portland deals with it's racial past it, and its companies are not going to attract a big black workforce."
1408,"Well I did some research and turns out that according to the ACS in Oregon only 1,9% of the population is black. So the company actually hires above the population ratings. Perhaps the problem is on the state level and not so much on the company. I believe that Adidas carries a great message to be ruined without some context."
1409,"Being black in the Pacific Northwest, especially in the Portland metro area, is tough. Oregon had laws on the books that banned black people from taking up residency, and like many cities had a slew of over discriminatory laws that disadvantaged black people. The flooding of Vanport is eerily reminiscent of the aftermath of Katrina on New Orleans.

Portland also has what I'd like the call the ""liberal brand"" of racism and discrimination. People have black lives matter signs outside their homes but shy away from sending their kids to mixed schools, they work for companies which claim to celebrate diversity but have little to no black people (or people of color) on staff. Most insidious of all, they fight tooth and nail to back laws that stifle the chance for black people to get a share of the American dream, consistently fighting housing reform and expansion of transportation lines."
1410,"There is a racial achievement gap in America.  This isn't a shoe company issue.

It's a reflection of the fact that, sorting the U.S. population by race, blacks, whites, Asians and hispanics get different test scores, drop out of high school, go to college, business school, etc. at different rates.

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_achievement_gap_in_the_United_States"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_achievement_gap_in_the_United_States</a>

So any ""study"" purporting to simply compare total population percentage vs. workforce misses huge confounding variables.  

As far as I know, ""diversity and inclusion"" doesn't mean hire a high-school drop out when you need a high-school graduate.

Bottom line:  this kind of analysis is misleading, in all industries, in all contexts."
1411,"This article is another sign that this country is actually doing pretty well on race relations. The piece cites the low number of black employees but provides absolutely zero evidence of any actual discrimination. Only vague complaints of feeling uncomfortable, along with unsupported claims of being passed over for promotion (haven't we all). The comically absurd uproar over the white sneaker design really takes the cake. Again, if this is what passes for racism these days, we have made tremendous progress."
1412,"Adidas in German-owned.

My four-years residency in Europe taught me that the USA is much less racist than the ""old"" continent."
1413,Sad but not surprised. You would think a brand that is mostly associated with hip hop culture would do better but like most corporations it?s just about getting black money to give to white people.
1414,"Your opinions aren't valued?  Passed up for that promotion you know is rightfully yours?  Someone said or did something to make you uncomfortable?  Management is ineffective?  The employee workforce isn't representative of its customers or the population at large?  Are there any major companies that would pass this purity test?

The only reason this is a story is because Adidas does all these things while also pandering heavily to the very group of people who feel aggrieved.  But that same group is too awed by a Beyonce instagram advertisement *er* post to notice or care.  For such a woke generation, it's a little hypocritical.  Cognitive dissonance."
1415,"Adidas should institute a quota system. In fact, every industry and business should institute quotas. I suggest we start with Uber. I see that their drivers, particularly in NYC, are disproportionately male. Let?s boycott Uber until they have more female drivers. And then let?s move on to the public schools. Too many female teachers. Clearly, discrimination at work. And don?t get me started on HR departments at every big corporation. Females all through!"

He was against giving the workers any rights or protection and he refused them citizenship. Now its time for reparations. Maybe Stanford University should create a special scholarship for Chinese Americans?
1418,Loved your story about Chinese influence on America and their contribution to our great country. Here in Idaho there are many places still calling out the Chinese contribution to the mining in the 1860' s and later. China Fork Creek still has remnants of Chinese diggings - ditches and holes where they mined after the others miners thought it was done. They did very well. Much to my dismay in the 1960's here in Boise urban renewal was all the rage. I still remember on Capitol Blvd the City of Boise evicted the last remaining Chinese merchant from his building where he lived and ran the last Chinese apothecary I know about in the inter mountain west. To build a high-rise bank of all things - shameful. The Chinese influence on Boise and all over Idaho still exists if one is interested. Chindin Blvd here in Boise - Chinese Gardens. How cool is that
1419,"Here is a comment that the Times won?t publish:

If Black people knew what is good for them they would have voted for Bernie last time over Hillary; and of course, vote for him in 2020.

It puzzles me why they do not do that which is so obvious.  Even more obvious than why working class people should vote for Bernie (irrespective of color, gender and any other relevant factor).

So why don?t they? 

They are afraid of the worse case scenario. They are much more risk averse then white folk.  I probably would be too if My people were enslaved for the longest time; liberated when economics rather than ethics dictated the move; kept as second (or worse) class citizens in the back of buses, away from white folk?s schools and even latrines.  Even their relative equality after MLK has had economic motivation.  In the brilliant bio of James Baldwin, there are the commercials from several companies pitching their cars, household appliances and hygienic products to the up and coming Black middle-class.  Now working in Motown and making enough to afford a Ford as that evil genius thought they would!

They are afraid that if they vote for ?radical? change (like living wages, healthcare and public education for all ? stuff taken for granted in the civilized world) they will bring back the slave drivers.

I understand that primal fear.  Like most fears, it is irrational.

My fellow Americans who are black, take a chance and vote for Bernie.  He is a mensch. And that is good for everyone."
1420,"Democrats are facing an evil person in Trump. 
Some one who has no moral boundaries, trivializes Truth, terrorizes those who oppose or contradict him, is maliciously abusive and combative, never accepts wrongdoing, knows how to crush the opposition....and worse, employs all these tactics to  drive his followers into a frenzy with  ""Hitler-like ""rhetoric"".
Unless the 20  disparate Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election get their act TOGETHER.. .the country will fall under the spell of Trump for 4 more yrs."
1421,"The arrogant fallacy that blacks are an automatic vote remains alive and well in the Democratic Party. As the Dems go further left on policies such as decriminalized border entry, the average black and white are more concerned about how those illegals may compete for scarce jobs. Dems somehow believe the far left climate change rhetoric dreamed up in cocktail parties somehow connects with a blue collar black and white worker barely making a living wage. 

Whites in the same socio-economic group as many blacks were dismissed by Hillary as ?deplorables? in 2016 and we know how that turned out. Poor whites throughout the swing states in Greater Appalachia have no set party and vote each election based on perception of respect, jobs and programs they value.  I believe that blacks in the US are fundamentally no different than their white counterparts.  Due to a similar lack of respect by Dem elites, a Candace Owens or other dynamic leader on the Rep side could easily cause blacks to begin a shift of allegiances from Dems as a group.  If so, they will go their own way in every election like their white counterparts. The question is how can Dems address this arrogant disregard of issues important to this key voting group in time to stop Trump in 2020."
1422,"""No one should take Black Voters for granted"".  Very true; and that is because Black people (collective) is and and never has been a monolith.
While it is true that the gains and benefits derived from the civil rights struggle came, mostly from a national recognition and acceptance that Black people was indisputably America's victim. The victim card is no longer the only recourse available to the masses. In fact, although the field is still far from level, many Black people have seized the opportunities to elevate, both socially and economically. In 21st.century America there is clear diversity of thoughts, values and ethics in the Black community.
It may take much more time to shake the victim syndrome, and there will always be those who are convinced that the Tribe must always be on the mental reservation. No! No.
Blacks are not in lockstep. There is a lot of ""woke"" in there."

In the case of black voters Dems need massive black voter turnout because black voters are voting 90% for Democratic candidates.

The Democratic Party is completely dependent on black voter turnout in order to win elections."

1425,"In this column the NYT allows Mr. Edsall to falsely assert that Medicare for All advocates are proposing to enroll everyone in a national health insurance program and ?eliminate? private health insurance. In fact, no Medicare for All proponent supports banning private health insurance. For example, Bernie Sanders? Senate bill ? which is co-sponsored by other candidates like Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren ? bans private health coverage that duplicates the coverage offered by the government, because it would be rendered obsolete, and still allows for supplemental private coverage. Please stop misrepresenting Medicare For All. 

Over 27.5 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2018 according to the latest Census Bureau report. Why is that acceptable to Mr. Edsall or anyone else at the NYT?"
1426,"Black voters were always more centrist on many social issues advanced by Democrats. Racism was an exception to that. They were very aware of racism.

If black voters now have a more nuanced view of racism, perhaps that is because racism has become more nuanced. It is still there, I'm not suggesting it is a thing of the past. 

However, it is changing, and the black voters are changing with that. They naturally know it best, as the direct targets."
1427,"I believe it was Edsell?s column from last week that spoke to the difference between the loudest segments of the parties. The loudest leftists are the college educated folks who haven?t done well in our economy(& who resent the ones who have done well). The loudest right wingers are the non college educated folks who have a skilled trade or a successful small business(& who think everyone else is a slacker).

Republicans have no core principals any longer that they can point to after backing Trump almost universally, and the Democrats promise the world and haven't  aligned themselves with their interests. The only differentiation is the pre-election pandering, because after winning and being sworn in, after you sort through the rhetoric and the promises that seldom turn into action, in most cases the same special interests are buying both parties. The billion dollar question is do any of the blocs become either repulsed by both parties or get disenchanted enough to start sitting elections out where they know candidates from either party won't serve their interests."
1429,"The fact remains blacks won't switch parties. Even if black Democrats don't like the candidate or their platform they won't vote for Trump, they'll just stay home at worst. This is unfortunate and does weaken the party, but the fact remains it is less dangerous than large numbers of white voters switching to Trump, which is what happened in 2016. When black voters stay at home on election day, low turnout can cost Democrats the election, or make it very close. When whites switch parties, it guarantees the district goes red, and can flip the entire state. The consequences of whites switching run deep, it costs more than just one election.

So it's not a wonder the DNP is preoccupied with ensuring there are no defections in 2020. That's why they've been trying to unify their diverse constituency through opposition to Trump. Progressive policies most Americans would have found hard to swallow are enjoying a lot more support now that they are being defined as fighting back against Trump. The progressive policies will win many young people over, and the anti-Trump sentiment will more or less lock in the fickle white voters.

The problem is with constituencies like black Democrats, who have large centrist and conservative blocs, who will not be energized by this progressive wave, but for whom defecting was never an option. They are locked into either supporting issues they don't care for, or not voting."
1430,"African American support for Hillary Clinton in 2016 may have been affected by people?s memories of her 2008 nomination fight against Barack Obama, and, of course, like others, the Republicans? decades long smear campaign against Mrs.  Clinton."
1431,"@Kurt S

 ""Their theory of the case for 2020 is that radical progressive agenda will energize minority communities the way it does college students and Brooklynites. But it won't.""

I don't believe the average black voter cannot be educated not to fear social democracy and Bernie.  College student and Brooklynites could be seen voting against their class and personal interests just as black voters do.

I believe theirs is almost a primal fear that drives black voters towards non-radical solutions.  Their history in this country is the cause.  That history is a horror story for the most part.  They want to make sure (instinctively at least in my opinion) not to cause a right-wing backlash that will punish them even more than they are punished now.  It is the psychology of the oppressed people.  It takes hundreds of years to take the ghettos and the plantations out of people's psyches.

The Times won't print this comment.  I have sent another more elaborate one earlier.  They don't like provocative statements even if they are rational and civil.  They betray their upfront statement to the comment box almost daily with me.  I don't like giving up just because the paper is now ran by people who are not progressives and fair.  I read this paper for over 50 years daily.  So, I can take a chance I be persistent."
1432,"The authors and the studies they quote seem confuse correlation with causation. They miss the economic differences in aggregate between black and white voters. The income and wealth disparity is significant and better explains the differences in their answers. Blacks in the USA have adapted to be much more practical and incremental because they have been terrorized and killed when they pushed hard for justice, both socially and economically.  If the studies controlled for this disparity it was not reported. 
NYT is now a proponent of the ""keep to the center"" drumbeat, perhaps to reduce the chance that a true progressive takes office and reverses tax benefits to large corporations. Regardless, 2016 showed that pandering to the muddled middle loses net votes by reducing progressive base voting. 2018 confirmed that true progressives can win even in red districts. That in a nutshell is why Hillary failed to get a sufficient number of votes to counter the vote theft by Russia and their GOP/NRA/Donor co-conspirators. Bernie would have trounced Trump but the DNC never gave him a fair shot."
1433,"Democrats should focus on three universally approved topics, and contrast their plans with the Republican coddling of the 1%.
ANYTHING MORE DILUTES THE MESSAGE 

1. Economic fairness and security

Elizabeth Warren's main message of economic fairness and security for the working class is the foundation which brings together all varied constituencies of the Democratic Party, and even voters in red States who have been hurt economically by Trump's policies.

2.Protection of healthcare as a human right

Democrats should highlight their real protection of healthcare, (whether by enhancing Obamacare or by implementing medicare-for-all.) They should highlight the many, many Republican attempts to undermine or take their healthcare away.

3. Gun safety laws
A high percentage of the country agrees upon implementing Universal background checks, red flag laws, and possibly even assault rifle bans. Republicans are owned by the NRA."
1434,"The African-American vote is not monolithic and neither political party should take their interests for granted.

Southern African-American women handed Hillary the nomination with multiple southern states the Democrats had no hope of carrying in the general election and Biden is hoping he can play the same card. We all know how well that worked out.

In order to win, Democrats need a candidate that will energize the base and independent voters like myself that tend to vote for Democrats over Republicans. I am not a ?vote for blue no matter who?, however. Joe Biden will not get my vote regardless of what the alternative is. I am tired of corporate Democrats- ?centrist? in NYT speak. After almost 40 years of Democrats backing up and trying to placate Republicans by only gutting the New Deal an inch at a time, we need someone who will punch back, reach out to voters and say enough."
1435,"Sorry, polling from 15 years ago is not relevant."
1436,"Indeed, don't take any voters for granted. But even if that advice is heeded, the election may still be rigged, thanks to disenfranchisement such as this:

""More than 1,000 US Polling Sites Closed Since Supreme Court Ruling, Report Finds

1437,"Democrats have taken African-Americans for granted for decades, while Republicans have barely paid any attention to them, at best, for just as long.  Funny how that happens, especially when you consider that Trump can win without the African-American vote and Democrats can't win without it.  When you factor in the newer and growing Hispanic and Latino influences in election politics, things get even more confusing as well as even more important."
1438,"It appears to me that the Democratic Party is relying on people of color believeing one of your closing lines: ""...as Trump and his Republican Party whip up fear and demonize gays, lesbians, feminists, immigrants from Latin America and the Middle East, and people of color generally.""  Indeed I would argue that not only has that question not been asked as to its belief by people of color, but that it is part of the new Alt Left Orthodoxy to be believed as gospel rather than discussed, nuanced and more honestly parsed.  It is in short one of those far left take it for granted quasi policy of the Democratic Party that a lot of very intelligent people of color may seriously disagree with much as the other policies you describe.  The danger is painting with such a very broad and dismissive brush."
1439,"When the polls show that some Blacks against ?Government handouts? I hope they are referring to the handouts to Businesses and the wealthy are what they are talking about not social safety nets. 
There is more given to businesses and the wealthy through tax loopholes and incentives for businesses and the wealthy than ever will be given to every day citizens. 

The only way this can be rectified is to vote every Republican holding either a House Seat or Senate seat to be voted out of office. They have proven over and over that they do not care about anyone except their donors. Moreover the same has to happen at the State level. 

I don?t care what color we are, but it has been proven over and over that economically dis-advantaged citizens are the losers when Republicans hold the power. 
This is no time to worry about pro-choice or Pro-life, anti LBGT or pro LBGT, pro Immigration or Anti Immigration. At the rate we are going under the Republicans we won?t have any choices."
1440,"In SC, as I understand it, many black voters are socially conservative in terms of issues like a woman's right to choose, but fiercely liberal in terms of race, education, economics and some other issues.  Some party operatives are still angry about the long oppression of black people in this state.

On the other hand, a good number of retired, educated black people have moved to SC in the last 10-15 years.  That gives me hope that social inequities are not as bad as they once were and that they will improve further as whites get to know blacks who are quite different from those of 50 years ago.  

We need to be talking, we whites and blacks, so that we can move ourselves into political office and achieve our agenda."
1441,"My explanation for this is that the Democrats have largely lost the white working class to the Republicans, but they retain the black working class. This means that when you divide Democratic voters by race, the black group will reflect more working class attitudes than the white group. This will tend to make them more conservative than white Democrats on many social issues. Comparing the white working class (heavily Republican) with the black working class (heavily Democratic), the primary difference is that the white working class is much more cynical about government social programs and civil rights initiatives and much more positive about the government's police powers. The black working class flips those attitudes and is in this way much more like other Democrats. A lot of the white working class cynicism about government stems of course from the perception that government helps blacks and disadvantages whites?with racial resentment being a large factor in the white working class's switch from Democrat to Republican."
1442,If those voters who elected Obama stand up again they will defeat Trump. If not they will deserve the alternative.
1443,"I can only hope that radicalized progressives read this and take it to heart. Their theory of the case for 2020 is that radical progressive agenda will energize minority communities the way it does college students and Brooklynites. But it won't. The Obama surge in turnout was a one-off cultural and historical event. It will not be duplicated by running a white Harvard professor or a Debs-inspired socialist. Remember that both Warren and Sanders represent very-white New England. They have almost no traction with blacks outside that region.
This article is but one of one of the many warning signs that the Dems are ignoring but that history will recall when pundits are analyzing why the Dems lost a winnable race in 2020."
1444,For how long are Germans supposed to feel a personal guilt about what happened in WW2? Don't take me wrong. I know what happened and it is terrible and should not be forgotten or even worse denied. But is it realistic to expect that attitudes of young people whose grand parents were probably children during those days will not change with the times?  We Americans don't feel a personal guilt about mass killing of the indigenous population or slavery. We acknowledge these were atrocities but relate to these as  to other terrible things throughout the history. Do Catholics feel personal guilt for the crimes of the Inquisition?
1445,"Mistake No 1 was attributing the horrors of Nazism to a shadowy group known as the Nazis, as if it was  a shadow, infiltrating entity separate from German society. The harsh truth is  the Nazis were mainstream. Once Hitler came to power they became normalised in German society and 90% of the population acquiesced, whether passively or actively, to their ideology and methods. The intolerance and hate of Nazism is no different to what is bottled up in all societies. It is a core part of the darkness in human nature.  Until we truly internalise this in ourselves, accept it and remain vigilant of it, societies will be doomed to rhyme with the past."
1446,"Still, for all that, the Germans are still way ahead of the US as far as coming to terms with the past goes. How many Americans think seriously today about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and what it implies for our sense of nationhood? The history of 250 years of enforced servitude on the part of the ancestors of a large portion of the population (and then officially sanctioned discrimination for another 100 years)? The Germans have (with obvious exceptions) largely taken responsibility for their past--in the schools, in public debate, even in the ""stumble stones"" of their cities. Have we?"
1447,"In 2017 I was invited back to Dresden, the city where I was born, and I went with my 15 year old granddaughter because I wanted her to see a part of her family's history.  The city government had prepared a comprehensive look at the past of our small group.  We stayed on an extra day, the day an AfD demonstration took place in a square near our hotel and, out of curiousity, we went to it.  As the swastika is prohibited, the flags surrounding the speaker's stand were those of the state of Saxony.  Standing near us was a group of about 20 high school students.  At one side of the square was a roped- off area containing hundreds of people.  Every time the AfD speakers shouted into the loudspeakers, the high school students booed and the people in the roped off area pulled out whistles and blew them to drown out the speakers.  Two days later the NYT published a story and photo of the weekly rally with no mention whatsoever of the the students or the whistle blowers.  Even though I was only 1-1/2 years old when my parents and I left Dresden, I was terrified by the 
AfD speakers but heartened by the presence of the students, the police (many), the whistle blowers, and the warm intentions of the city government that had invited me.  Who will be the Germany of the 21st century, the AfD or the people with the whistles?"
1448,"While Germany remains heads and hearts above the rest of the world in coming to terms with its past, that work will always be finite and unfinished business because its root cause is the worst part of human nature.  'Never again' has become 'Never again and again and again and again.'  Sadly, each time it's mentioned that phrase loses a bit more of its agency and therefore becomes, as Hannah Arendt so aptly described it, 'The banality of evil.'
That doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to try because we all still have everything to lose if we don't."

1452,"The fact is while the fascist  Germany was not a place I would want to live, their great downside was not their politics, attitudes, nationalism, self absorption, or cultural delusion. They held the 1936 Olympics and nations went there and Hitler was master of ceremonies, no apparent problem, hardly a pariah. 

The problem that made the shoe drop was their MILITARISM not their ugly values. Had the Germans not used military might to advance their project, they would have been an obnoxious, paternal, narrow-minded and eventually rich nation that other countries could do business with, some would like and others loath. Kinda like a white utopian Saudi Arabia with income based on engineering instead of oil. 

It's very popular to skip the realities of history so you can make believe what you learned the hard way you always knew anyway, that your moral victory was intentional. But consider a simple conjecture as example, one that at the time was believed: reflect on a Europe that after the Munich agreement the Germans kept their word to Chamberlain, and took no military action against another nation. In that case England, France, and the USSR would have carried on vast economic deals with Germany, and ignored her internal affairs. That is to say; it was German militarism, not German racism or crazed white superiority social theories, that both caused the demise of relations and so now allows the West to presume today it's always had a moral upper hand."
1453,"""In my neighborhood in Berlin, and others across the country, people wearing Jewish headgear are harassed on the street. ""

You can judge the whole article by the implication versus the reality of who is doing the harassing. It's not the AfD. The AfD has strong Jewish membership last I heard. And that ""Jew"" is again a common curse on Germany's school yards has also nothing to do with AfD kids. By the way, the whole idea to quench authoritarian tendencies by more ""moral reckoning"" is just a little daft. That's like telling ISIS activists about more reasonable and historically accurate moderate Islamic views."
1454,"This shouldn't be a surprise, the things feeding this surge in anti semitism, xenophobia and so forth is not something unique to Germany. I am sorry to hear that there are people in Germany who think things like Germany was the victim in World War II, but it doesn't surprise me, it doesn't take long for memories to fail, and then suddenly we will see people in Germany clammoring that the 'other side' be taught in school (does anyone doubt that a German version of Fox News wouldn't be putting a positive spin on Nazi Germany?). 
Just think of the US, where the right wing complains about history that talks about the faults of the US, where the religious right and the GOP proclaim routinely that the US could do no wrong, that we were 'blessed by God', or that we have history being taught that dismisses slavery as the primary cause of the Civil War and promotes the idea it was fought over ideals,and that slavery ""wasn't too bad"" (Yes, Texas, your curricula, among others).   It is an attempt to sanitize the past to justify such behavior in the here and now, and it knows no country, it is much like the myth that something like Nazi Germany ""couldn't happen here"", when history proves it could, if not in the same form, with the same root causes and yes, with unthinkable outcomes."

1460,""" Forty percent of Germans say it?s right to blame Jews for Israel?s policies in the Middle East""

I'd argue ""Israel's policies in the Middle East"" are what they are because the Jews collectively figured what you are reporting in Germany was bound to happen all over again ... in Germany, in the rest of Europe, and certainly after seeing what ""land for peace"" and ""taking risks for peace"" (as lectured to Israelis by no end of pundits with no skin in the game such as the NY Times stable of columnists) in Gaza, in southern Lebanon and in the non-stopping antisemitic incitement by the PA who rejected every generous peace proposal giving them a state even including re-partition of Jerusalem -- only to be answered by more PA-sponsored hate and intifadas costing a 1000 Israeli lives.

The other irony of course is that the Germans bleed so much for the Palestinians in their conflict with the Jewish state (wonder how much they'd bleed if the Palestinians were in conflict with any other nation other than the Jewish one?), but see how the Germans would react if their ""cherished"" Palestinians -- virtually all Muslim -- began to migrate en mass to Germany.  Then we'd hear a new story, no doubt."
1461,"The current top Reader Pick says, ""Well, the obvious question is, has America forgotten the history of Germany? Seems like our current situation is an eerie repetition of events almost a century ago."" 

I can't help but wonder if the author and those who recommend the comment are themselves at all aware of German and American history. There simply is no similarity between German and American history. Germany post World War I was an economic wasteland. The U.S. is not. Nazi Germany made the annihilation of massive groups of people (e.g. Jews, Roma, gays, etc.) an end in itself, not a means. The U.S. at its worst removed, enslaved, and killed people for economic reasons, a means to an end. Germany did not become a country until 1871, after a semi-imperialist conquest by Prussia. The U.S. was formed a century earlier by the voluntary coming together of independent British colonies. One could go on......

So others may see it, I am reposting here Blackmamba's comment for perspective: 

""The Holocaust was not perpetrated in America by Americans against other Americans. The Holocaust was not perpetrated in Europe by Arab, Kurdish, Persian and Turkish Muslims. The Japanese Empire did not kill 30 million Chinese because they were Jewish. The Japanese Empire did not invade Southeast Asia and the Indo-Malaya and the South Pacific because of Jews. Nazi Germany did not kill 27.5 million Soviet citizens because they were Jewish. Only one holocaust is the Holocaust. Not Rwanda nor Darfur."""

It was widely reported truth that ?Victims would be seized and subjected to every imaginable manner of physical torment, with the torture usually ending with being hung from a tree and set on fire. Often victims would be dismembered and mob members would take pieces of flesh  bone as souvenirs.

Often mobs were aided and abetted by law enforcement (indeed, they often were the same people). Officers would routinely leave a black inmate?s jail cell unguarded after rumors of a lynching began to circulate to allow for a mob to kill them before any trial or legal defense could take place?.

I do not imagine that America is any better now, not after the election of Trump whose ideals were more in tune with Ku Klux Khan Ideology. He has visceral hatred for everything Obama stood, merely because of extreme colour prejudice.

?The lynching?as horrible as such a thing can be. Lynching in itself is a fearful reproach to American civilization. Lynching by fire is the vengeance of a savage past ? The sickening outrage is the more deplorable because it easily could have been prevented?.

1481,"Extremely disturbing to see how we have come, and how far we have to go.  There should be monuments Sergeant Woodard and Judge Waring."
1482,"This book touches on the central problem of American society, as outlined by Annette Gordon-Reed, Charles Warren Professor of American Legal History at Harvard Law School and Professor of History at Harvard University. Writing in the Foreign Affairs Journal, February 2018, in her article ?America?s Original Sin, Slavery and the Legacy of White Supremacy?
<a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-12-12/americas-original-sin"" target=""_blank"">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-12-12/americas-original-sin</a>
she quotes historian Edmund Morgan who argued that racially based slavery, rather than being a contradiction in a country that prided itself on freedom, made the freedom of white people possible. ?The system that put black people at the bottom of the social heap tamped down class divisions among whites. Without a large group of people who would always rank below the level of even the poorest, most disaffected white person, white unity could not have persisted. Grappling with the legacy of slavery, therefore, requires grappling with the white supremacy that preceded the founding of the United States and persisted after the end of legalized slavery.? And persists today."
1483,"Would that the President read this book.
Did I just write this?
In my dreams.
Sigh."
1484,"Judge Gergel's story about one of his predecessors also highlights how quickly the Democratic party split from its segregationist core once the racial violence in former Confederate states became widely known. That rift became formal only 2 years after the Woodard case, in 1948, at the Democratic national convention that nominated President Truman. 
The Republican party's long march toward winking at segregaton also began there, but it quickly shifted into a sprint in 1980 when Ronald Reagan launched his run for the presidency in Mississippi where three young civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. "
1485,My father who died in 2009 shared with a story while was a member of the Army Air Core which the start of what is now the United States Air Force.  Being a young black man from the north he had no idea of how bad black people treated in the south.  He said a member of his unit was beat to death because did not show proper respect for a white person.  The tragedy about that is that under the trump administration we are back there again.  
1486,"I can't help but consider Isaac Woodard's mother, pictured in the photo with the review. I can't imagine what she and the rest of the family suffered right along with Isaac after sending their son off to fight in the war initiated by a country that cared little for them.  Can one even fathom how much the family's lives changed as a result of this horrible injustice to Sgt. Woodard.  America is a brutal, awful place for people of color, in 1946 as well as 2019."
1487,"The Old South was founded on and built on racial exploitation and brutality.  Its churches, which condoned and justified slavery, and its courts and legal systems, all committed to cruelty and torture under legal and religious fictions, were outrages against decency.  The White Supremacists of today, and the politicians and charlatans like Trump, who wink and nod in approval of their bestial hatreds, declare themselves not fit to live in the world of today or to be citizens of the United States."
1488,"I remember vividly how Bill Douglas tried to utilize the14th Amendment to extend Federal due process to combat racist State  statutes and how he was castigated as being an ""activist Judge""
States rights was the much to be regretted concession necessary to allow formation of the Republic. In retrospect, we mightily be better off if we had paid the tea tax. Just look at where States rights and refusal to pay taxes have brought us."
1489,A reminder of why I still pay the NYT subscription.
1490,Thank you for bringing this book to our attention.  I need to reread Simple Justice and examples like the one shared here to bring more detail and relevancy for the Civil Rights Movement for my students.
1491,A wonderful review on a most vital subject.  I immediately penned it in at the top of my BUY NOW list.
1492,"It is somewhat discouraging to see how long it has taken to end white supremacy in the United States. South Africa, the former poster-boy of racism, overcame it?s apartheid in the last century. 

The fight against inequality is a constant, multi-generational battle with backsliding like (Holder?13) a threat. This book is a reminder of how far we?ve come and how far there is still to go."
1493,"Thank you , Professor Blight , for researching and writing this book.  In light of current events, it is especially timely to remember that when people understand the inhumanity of Jim Crow attitudes, some may be able to change their mind  and behavior toward the racism which is both implicit  and explicit in our culture.  "
1494,Just think of the millions of sneaky infants who would try this ploy if the Pompeo were not so vigilant.
1495,"My daughter was born in Peru.  We were US citizens but because she was born less than five years after I became a US citizen, she was given a green card and after 5 years got her American passport.  Why don?t they get their daughter a resident visa (green card) so she can travel? That shouldn?t be so hard! Also, she will never be able to run for President because she was not born in the USA."
1496,"I believe this child has the right to be an American citizen. I also believe that two intelligent men should have thought this through a bit more and gotten on a plane with their surrogate and had the child delivered in the US. Sure, they?d have to have paid the hospital bill, but there would have been no question as to the child?s citizenship."
1497,"If children had rights and power to ask, how do we answer to questions like , why i cannot have a mothers care? where is mothers milk for me to drink? i do not support surrogacy. its against nature and human beings are just exploiting the technology."
1498,"For an administration that calls itself pro family, their actions in this case, and others are anything but.
Heartless.
Cruel.
Absolutely inept."
1499,Republicans love children . . . until they?re born.
1500,The birth mother wasn?t American. The egg donor wasn?t American. The sperm donor wasn?t American. The only Americans involved in this enterprise were the people who put up the money. How American.
1501,"Republicans, such amazing deep faith and believe in the sanctity of human life and family, but only when it meets their vary narrow definition. Anything one or situation that falls outside of their narrow definition, then sub-human and deserve no consideration; immigrants (children and families), poor children and families who need SNAP, medicare or health insurance, anyone not white or hetro, any child in this country in our underfunded public school systems."
1502,"Idiocy. This is pure, unadulterated idiocy. If the parents were heterosexual, it?s possible there would be roadblocks, but fewer, as the parental relationship would not be in question; for that matter, a heterosexual couple wouldn?t have to be married. 

It is time that this country updates such laws for a variety of issues; in this case, for both the orientation of the parents, and the adoption laws and how they apply in such cases. There are so many unwanted children out there - why make it so hard for the parent?s citizenship status to apply?"
1503,"Republicans, once again, showing their lack of family values. This is reprehensible, but not the least bit surprising.

This is MAGA!!"
1504,"Perhaps Melania's parents could become the Godparents. After all, they skated right in and became instant citizens."
1505,"I just looked at the state departments website and they have a new article 309a that contradicts the claims in your article. Unless I misunderstood. Here is a link : <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel_old/en/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-child-born-abroad.html"" target=""_blank"">https://travel.state.gov/content/travel_old/en/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-child-born-abroad.html</a>"
1506,"These laws actually protect people.  The Times should have contextualized this situation in light of the more and more common practice of rich, white Americans (and other first worlders) going to impoverished third world countries and using cheap surrogates.  Compassion for infertile couples should not blind people to the fact these practices can and will be abused.   We need to keep or pass laws that make the abuse harder, not easier, to accomplish.  Also, the assumption that a homosexual couple should, if they desire, have a child and raise it without the benefit of either a mother or father, is a degree of selfishness that should automatically disqualify them from parenthood."
1507,"Sarah Mervosh failed to include that the law does not extend to the offspring of the child who received citizenship at birth through an American parent, in this case, the father born in Britain. Had they done their due diligence they would have discovered as much."
1508,This is gratuitously crude and should be reversed.
1509,"The U.S. also discriminates against children adopted abroad. I'm American. My husband and I have lived in South Africa for 15 years, and we recently adopted a baby girl. Because we adopted her here in South Africa, despite the country complying with all the Hague Convention rules on adoption, we can't directly apply for citizenship. We have to wait two years, apply for an immigration visa, move with her to the U.S. and then apply for citizenship. If we were living in the U.S. when we adopted her, she would have arrived with a U.S. passport."
1510,"Infertile couples who cannot bear children and adopt internationally must jump through hoops to obtain citizenship for their foreign-born child.  This case is little different.  The biological father is a US citizen but lacks residency needed for the child to acquire citizenship.  The non-biological father and other parents in the same situation should simply adopt, and the child will become a US citizen upon entering the US.  This isn?t discrimination any more than requiring infertile couples to complete an international adoption according to The Hague Convention in order to establish US citizenship for the child.    The surrogate is the biological mother, not some inanimate host.  She willingly surrendered her parental rights but will always remain the biological mother who carried that child inside her for nine months."
1511,"in France, the surrogacy/citizenship problem is even more surreal.

1) Surrogacy is illegal in France.
2) French couples (straight or gay) who go to the US for surrogate births, wind up with American children who do not have French citizenship. (So at least there is no discrimination against gay parents.)
3) But worse, the French authorities don't even recognize the biological American children as the *children* of the French parent (because surrogacy is illegal!). (At least the US authorities recognize that the British child of the American couple *is* the child of the couple or at least the child of the biological father.)"
1512,"How hideous that they refer to the woman who donated the egg, the woman who carried it (one in the same), and the egg and sperm themselves as mere aspects of ?reproductive technology?."
1513,. . . yet another reason to despise this administration.
1514,"It's the pettiness of this administration that is so staggering.  Is there no part of human life in the U.S. that they can not try to intrude their would-be theocracy, their cruelty?"
1515,"This is ridiculous. Aren?t adoptees from foreign countries considered citizens? Yes, they are. One of my children was born overseas and is still considered an American citizen. Children of American citizens are definitely citizens."
1516,I have friends that are going through the same thing. It's a law. They are a heterosexual couple.
1517,"The state department is prosecuting anti-gay policy here. 

If the child had been placed for international adoption, and to a gay parent or parents, the child would become a US citizen immediately upon arriving on US soil.... period.. full stop. 

There is no reason for a selective double standard here... regardless of where you may fall on the personal view about a gay parent or parents adopting a child.  In reality... surrogacy is no different as long as all national and international laws are followed."
1518,This is nothing less than cruel. Typical of this administration.
1519,"I'd be interested in the detective work on the KKK /blackface picture.  There must be paper files on the yearbook.  Allegations are one thing, proof is another.   It certainly was odd behavior for Northam to admit it was him and then to deny it the next day.  Fake news?

I consider myself a feminist too, but the assault allegations against the Lt. Governor are one thing.  Destroying a career is another.  As has been pointed out before, there are female liars too.  The ""Me Too"" movement at times has taken on a tinge of hysteria.  Did we learn nothing from history with the McCarthy anti-communist hysteria?

Maybe the one solid product of the Me Too movement will be to give victims of assault , sexual or other, the courage to come forward immediately, not years later."
1520,"It truly astounds me the speed with which critics and allies alike jumped immediately to a demand to resign.

I suspect most of us behaved badly, in some fashion, when in our 20's. I also believe, and hope, that all of us have changed our beliefs and practices about certain social and moral issues in the course of 35 years. Whether it be race, abortion, homosexuality, or many other issues, I suspect that for all of us our beliefs of what is right, wrong and permissible has changed from our attitude of our mid-twenties. If nothing else, we have grown a strong ""filter"" to stop us from doing something on impulse because it was a party atmosphere.

To condemn Gov. Northam for a distasteful act that long ago, without factoring the qualities he has exhibited in the remainder of his life is to deny that a person can change, be forgiven or obtain redemption.

To deny the prospect of redemption causes a person to more likely remain locked in old beliefs. 

Second, if you will only allow yourself to have allies who have never sinned, you will have a very lonely life. 

Third, There are more important ""fish to fry"". The distraction and damage to alliances kerfuffles like this cause only delay advances on present day important issues.

Take a breath. Get over it. Move on."
1521,"The picture was revolting, and it?s true he should have known better at his age. Yet I wonder what kind of life he?s led in the 35 years since.

I ask the following question only in general terms, and not in reference to this case specifically. While an act may be inexcusable, can the person be forgiven after a life of good works? Our country desperately needs to reach a place of reconciliation and healing. Again, speaking generally, that goal may not be best served by applying a zero-tolerance policy for offenses that are decades old. Perhaps it would be better served by making some allowance for redemption.
"
1522,"?The insinuation is 100 percent not true, and frankly it?s offensive.?

In US politics these words smell like rats--thanks to Trump.  Today--there is no way for a politician to credibly declare innocence."
1523,"Gov. Northam Has stated that the photos and other activities no longer reflect your views.  I believe him but I also believe that he must take personal responsibility for his previous actions. This personal responsibility must go beyond words and platitudes.  Specifically, he should make a personal financial contribution to one or more institutions that serve predominately persons of color.  Examples of where this contribution could be made are the NAACP, Historically Black Colleges, or  The National Civil Rights Museum.  To demonstrate this personal responsibility at a meaningful level I recommend that he donate 1/4 of his net worth to these types of organizations.
If he did this, it would set a precedent for other individuals who need to account for their past racism.  It would prove that his lofty words are backed up by his actions.
"
1524,Without forgiveness there cannot be progress. Condemnation and punishment will lead to resentment and will not lead us out of this racial mess we've made. Lets talk.
1525,"Isn't it really up to the people of Virginia to decide if they want to keep Northam?

A poor precedent was set by the Republicans in the Kavanaugh hearings. Now we have 2 possible (probable)  molesters of women on the Supreme Ct. Aw gee said the Republicans, he was just a fun loving beer swilling kid and look at his record since. I guess the standard isn't the same for Democrats.

And Democrats you're very quick on throwing the 1st stone. Is it because your really horrified at the disgusting display of racism or are you all just being politically expedient? 

I'm getting so tired of the constant gotcha mentality in the press and in this country. Now this accusation about the Lt. Governor. Are we going to stone him too. Let's see the evidence.

There's more than one Roger Stone dirty trickster playing in the swamp."
1526,His wife's face speaks volumes.
1527,"Does anyone wonder why WAPO refused to publish a damning account of rape against a rising left wing politician because it couldn't corroborate the event. Recent events has shown neither the Washington Post, CNN nor most of the the mass media require any corroboration or even rudimentary fact checking before reporting not just uncorroborated but absolutely false negative claims against anyone on the right. Ironically, in this particular instance Fairfax himself has corroborated the encounter, hence the claimed lack of corroboration could only be the product of failing to inquire or the blind acceptance of a denial, which has not been disclosed."
1528,"Karma is a you-know-what. I'm sitting here with a bag of popcorn, thoroughly enjoying the Democrats destroying themselves using the same tactics they justified to be used against every single Republican nominee. Even more titillating is reading the multifarious comments by the NYT readers, falling all over themselves to excuse Northam's behavior because it occurred while he was in med school. Where was that sense of forgiveness with Justice Kavanaugh? Not to mention their chorus to nullify Fairfax's accuser because the details could not be proven, as there were no witnesses. Oh, but we are told we must believe the accuser. So why unquestioningly believe Blaisey-Ford but not the woman alleging that she was assaulted by Fairfax? I'm waiting for the disgraced and mercifully vaporized Avenatti to show up to defend her, but of course that won't happen. It was only a matter of time before this kind of oppo research came to bite the Democrats in the derriere. What is breathtaking is the abject hypocrisy of NYT readers, when even the Washington Post pushed back against Fairfax's sad backpedaling and denials. Moral of the story: all politicians of all parties have skeletons. If NYT readers want to excuse Northam's awful behavior in his youth in light of his subsequent record, then they should have applied the same standard to Kavanaugh. Got another bag of popcorn in the microwave waiting for the sequel. "
1529,"Everyone, think twice about what you post online. 

If print imagery that must be researched can be easily found and released then every crazy stupid thing you?ve ever done and posted is fair game. Once you share a photo with thousands of your ?friends? you can?t get it back. Once you send an email or text there is no guarantee the recipient will keep it confidential. 

If you don?t want it out there, don?t share it.

Anyone ever heard of revenge porn? 
"
1530,"Wow, there's nothing like burying the lede! Beyond the cloudiness of Gov. Northam's ridiculous transgression and the mountain-out-of-a-molehill follow-up on Lt. Gov. Fairfax lie the broader questions: who started this? Why? Why now? Who benefits?

Buried on page 18 of today's NYT hard copy are some answers - the real lede. Who? Big League Politics, a fringe pro-Trump hate machine, found the ""story"" and blew it up to benefit,  well, trumpism. Sadly,  Democrats took the bait and instantly formed the usual circular firing squad. 

So, why now?  (1) A ""librul"" was in power and might actually create progressive change. (2) So might his successor, who has the audacity to be black! (3) The trumpists needed another bright shiny object to distract from Trumps legal and moral issues. The roots of this firestorm don't forgive Gov. Northam, but they reveal what we need to know.

Is this Trump's fault? Not directly,  of course,  but his disgraceful ""leadership"" has written the permission slip for these fake journalist troublemakers to ""cut class,"" cut corners and pollute the political waters with their poison gossip. 

I wish The Times had given this origin story, the real one revealing the causes and not just the symptoms, at least equal billing with the ""ooh ain't it awful"" one. Let's hope it's not too late to shift the focus where it belongs. "
1531,"Crystal has impersonated Davis for years, and that Davis (who died in 1990) himself enjoyed it."
1532,"Because it appears to be demeaning, Northam certainly would have been over the line today and may have been over it decades ago. However, one does have to wonder about where the cultural appropriation line stands. Can only Germans wear lederhosen for Oktoberfest? What about sombreros for taco night? Then there's literature, film and stage where heritage seems increasingly important, but nobody questions ""Hamilton"" for its inaccurate depiction of America in the 18th century. Democrats who wade into this morass need to ponder if there is a bottom, and if anyone stands above it. "
1533,"""Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday renewed her call for him to step down, stating that Mr. Northam had ?admitted to enough involvement with racial stereotypes that he?s disqualified himself as governor.??

Warren has just taken a perilous political leap into the unknown.

If Northam hangs tough, remains on the job and continues advocating for affirmative racial policies -- as he's done in the past; 

If Northam is cleared of charges that he is neither the man in blackface nor the kkk guy; 

If Fairfax is dogged by sexual assault charges; 

or if Northam actually had no role in placing the objectionable photo on his yearbook page, then she will be badly damaged, politically speaking.

Trump got 53% of the white women's vote and even more of the white male vote.  It's hard to see how Warren's chances will improve with that demographic now that she's aligned herself against a moderate white Democrat.  What was she thinking?

Warren was lights out as a consumer advocate.  But she has lately burnished only her credentials as a crusader -- indignantly attacking those outside the boundaries of her ideology.

As a politician on the national stage ... she's positioned herself with yet another uphill battle."
1534,"Having read about the Tulsa Race Riot in 1921 and the long standing racism in the white population that tries to claim it never happened well into the 1990's one realizes that acceptance of racial bigotry is still alive. Even with 1984 being offered as a cudgel to claim Northam should have known different and demanding his present position to be retroactive. Can we accept a person who was insensitive to have changed their position? It appears tha Northam did change, is sorry for his past and wants to move forward but strident voices want him removed from the public square.

The past disqualifies you for the present regardless of the progress a person has made in recognizing the harm caused by past actions. How many of us want our past actions to disqualify us from particiting in the present? Can we allow a person to substantially change their views especially if the past views are abhorrent in today's world?"
1535,"Mockery and belittlement of another human being is an act of violence. It creates hurt. Who has never felt that? Sometimes that hurt, in the persons who are mocked and belittled, can endure for a very long time - even a lifetime. Mocking of others starts as a form of cruelty among schoolchildren, and when some of those children who enjoyed mocking others get older their mocking may subside outwardly, but inside, the cruelty of finding things in others to consider inferior - like the color of others? skin - continues, and few things in American society, if any, are more cruel, destructive, and violent than the thousands of manifestations of racism that plague us. Northam is a perpetrator of race-mockery, and he himself should have exposed what he did in 1984, and should have demonstrated sincere remorse for it - if that?s what he felt - a long, long time ago - LONG before 2019, when he was outed for it. To allow him to continue to be the governor of Virginia is to condone whatever gave him his feelings of superiority and impunity, in 1984, as a medical school graduate, when he mocked and belittled a culture - that of African-Americans - that has suffered centuries of racism and racist acts of violence, subjugation, and demonization in this country: it is inarguable that African-Americans have suffered far, far more than any other group in our history. If Northam were truly worthy to be governor, he would have long since ?unburied? and owned up to his racist acts of the past."
1536,"If the Democrats have any consistency in their positions, then they will be calling for the removal of Mr. Fairfax as loudly as they did for Justice Kavanaugh. Both men are accused of sexual assault, both deny it. "
1537,Why aren't we hearing from the Eastern Virginia Medical School that shamefully allowed this to be published in their yearbook? They are complicit.
1538,"What is the context of that photo? Is it a KKK rally? Both have beer cans in their hands-- a party? Halloween party?  An attempt to make light of a serious issue, or come to terms with opposites by juxtaposing characters ? I doubt that it was an attempt to make a racial slur. Look at his record. Actions speak louder than words or a photo not put in context."
1539,"This rush to condemnation, including with the Press, is getting very tiresome, to say the least.   I'm an old, white, liberal Democrat, and I'm disgusted with those in my party to rush to judgement so piously.   Young people can, and do, change.  I know I have changed about 180 degrees even after age 40.

So if Northam is forced out, what about Steve King...and a few others, including Trump."
1540,Americans far and wide look on in amazement as democrat politicians stumble over themselves to condemn transgressions of the ultra-liberal orthodoxy of the idiot fringe of the party.     May it long continue and welcome to your second term President Trump.
1541,"The weaponization of baggage crossed the line from reasonable to absurd when Al Frankin was crucified.   If the Democrats don't turn this type of weaponized attack into positives,  they will be doomed to cast their rocks from glass houses forever.  Instead of casting Frankin out why didn't the democrats offer opportunities to his accusers to help fight sexism?  What was gained by casting out one of their own?  It didn't stop Kavanaugh from becoming a such."
1542,Ralph Northam said that he is not one of the individuals on the picture. Why he did not get or at least try to get the mistaken picture corrected or supressed when the year book was published?
1543,"This is arguably the biggest non-story I've read in a while. Gov. Northam has offered a sincere apology so why the continuing barrage of vengeance? The political correctness involved only lends credence to republicans who are partially correct about democrats being elitist and out of touch. 

The photo in question could easily be interpreted in a couple of ways. As with Kavanaugh, beers were in hand and could be seen as signifying a joke about blacks and the Klan finally being on the same page sharing a brew together? Bad joke in bad taste for sure but hardly racist given the context. Regardless democrats are being particularly foolish about making a huge example of this. Didn't they learn from the Al Franken debacle? 

While I am inclined to vote for someone like Kamala Harris for president, I'd certainly give consideration to a republican  challenger to Trump given the nauseating and theatrical political correctness that has overtaken much of the democratic party. Gov. Northam's actions may have been foolish but passing blind judgment of racism defeats the cause. We should accept his heartfelt apology for offending people and move on. "
1544,"The emotionalism when it comes to the figurines described in this article and many other aspects of current hypersensitivity culture has become absurd. One of the problems with emotionalism is that different people experience different emotions and even a specific individual may perceive different emotions at different times.

Some may feel that these figurines are racist symbols while others may feel that they are just decorations or collectibles. However, by examining the photos of the objects included in this article, there is nothing overtly racist, hateful, or offensive about them. If the skin on these objects was white instead of black, they would just appear as innocuous figurines that are present in homes all across the country and the world. This is exemplified with the ""Mammy's Cupboard"" restaurant photo: The caption states that ""The woman's skin was painted a lighter shade during the civil rights era to address criticism.""

In the past, many rightfully complained when black people were underrepresented when it came to their depictions in common cultural items such as dolls. Some decried that many dolls and other toys overwhelmingly displayed white people and not people of other races. Now, when many items depict a black person, some claim offense even when there is nothing inherently offensive about the object.

Just as the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls are not meant as accurate representations of white people, neither are the ""Mammy"" objects meant to be realistic."
1545,"There is a place in Los Angeles that sells beautifully restored vintage stoves. The business is black owned and operated, but their showroom is kind of a museum of old time-y negro racist kitchenware. 

I think part of their daytime fun is watching the white customers (like me) squirm in discomfort while they smile casually and talk about the stoves. 

I like this business a lot, and I like their wry sense of humor. In almost any other setting, with almost any other business owners, it would be kind of appalling."

1547,"I (who is red) have a friend (who is black) - who said that that it isn?t ok for anyone to have any color appropriated memorabilia that might cause an offense.
I am jewish - we had a very small collection of Nazi stamps. I was offended by the persons in my family who collected them and at the same time I felt that it was ?ok? for us to feel free to collect such pieces.
When i had a trip to  northern Italy I came by a tourist store which sold Nazi and fascist memorabilia (cups with swastikas etc...).
I did feel offended - but that feeling is so obvious that I wouldn?t have expected the New York Times to write an article about it.
And likewise I am still unsure what is the value of this article. It is obvious you wouldn?t collect such collectibles if you knew that they offended  any persons or group. If the purpose of this article is to inform on the origin of such pieces, than an in depth analysis of similar items would have been appropriate.  But looking at those figures - it is obvious they are offensive - so who is this article meant for? Are you not at all certain that your readers would be able to understand such truths by themselves.

1553,"It seems clear thay the white folks who own these odious knick knacks, they like to decorate their homes with them because they cherish the reminder of their status in the pecking order."
1554,"One of the fundamental principals of white racism is to objectify and belittle the inferiority of another race. By using caricatures such as mammy jars, these images reinforce and condone these stereotypes of the docile, subservient black woman. The insidious nature of this racism is the link it creates to feelings of nostalgia. Childhood memories of previous family members are usually perceived as ""good"" memories. When the child grows old, they will look back upon their youth and recall these items that are linked both visually and tactilly to their family members. This is how they justify their position that these things are not offensive. If they are collectors, then their children or grandchildren may fall into the same trap,by establishing the same childhood link, and the cycle continues."
1555,Whats wrong with the doll?  Am I too racist to know?  Not racist enough?
1556,"Insulting, defaming, and dehumanizing black people is still allowed and defended. We'll never see the Republicans passing anti-black resolutions, will we? No other racial or religious group receives such constant and persistent denigration."
1557,The only people I have seen collecting this sort of material were doing so to document the history of racist visual culture.
1558,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Why does everything have to be turned into something ugly.
1559,"The reasons why people still collect things like this, as well as other colonial memorabilia that would be cringed upon today, I think is somewhat complex. But calling people racists for doing so I don't think is right, though I can fully understand why black people, as well as those around the world who've lived under colonialism, would feel degraded seeing such things. 

In a podcast with Kmele Foster, Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Coleman Hughes, and Thomas Chatterton Williams (all black intellectuals way ahead of their peers of any race, in my opinion), there is a segment that describes/explains this phenomenon and it is amazing in its ability to fill in holes and nuance of this topic which is hard to explain with words.  

At the 01:04:50 mark. It's truly interesting. The rest of the podcast is amazing in its own right.

1560,I don't understand why the doll would be considered offensive.
1561,"Why? Because they are a part of our country's history. Destroying them won't erase the past (or erase racism). We know this, right? How can we understand our present if we attempt to blot out the past? 

Not everyone collects them for nostalgic reasons, and not everyone who collects or owns them is white.

This article would make sense if it were ""Mammy Jars Mock Black People. Why Are They Still MADE?"""
1562,"The television show ""Married With Children"" was originally about a black family. It is interesting that you can change the skin color of the actors and it becomes an acceptable hit."
1563,"The lure of these images is quite simple.  For white folks, it's reminder of the good old days.

For Black folks, it's a reminder of the bad old days."
1564,When I was young  we used to buy Aunt Jemima syrup and Uncle Ben rice.  And my mother had an Aunt Jemima cookie jar.
1565,"I post this as there are only 32 comments, but most of just these alone are an astounding collection of rationalized racism.  We've got a long way to go."
1566,"Clearly, the objects are racist.  But so is American society, since its founding.

The objects are also historical artifacts, that one might own to teach others how racism was expressed in the past.  I would not advocate destroying the objects, as they can help teach American history, as this article does.  One might own the object and still reject the thinking of those who created it and for whom it was created.

My father fought in WWII.  The Germans shot him.  He saved some German artifacts from the war.  Certainly not in support of anything that they stood for."
1567,"We never had a Mammy Jar in my (White Southern) house.  I think even as a child I kind of knew that they weren't quite kosher, that they were quietly demeaning.  But how about those Aunt Jemima pancake mixes?  Are they still in business?
As for collecting them, people buy what they want.  There is no central committee of approved ceramic kitchenware.  People still buy and collect Nazi memorabilia, which bring very high prices, because it is forbidden.  Articles like this will only increase the value of such objectionable 'Mammy' art.   The people who collect it and like it don't care what you who take umbrage think.  It just makes the collection and possession of such objects more fun.  It's a bit of thumb in your eye mischief, which everybody likes.
I never thought much about buying a Confederate flag but when the great ban took place I got one,  a good one, made in America with stout cotton cloth, not that cheap Chinese printed nylon.  But I keep it hidden from view.  Being a 'southern boy' I know what it means and black people have nothing to fear from me because I do know what it represents. I won't waste time trying to explain it.  I bought it because they were being banned."
1568,"Some years ago I bought a house and its contents, which included a ceramic figure of a caricature black jockey.  

The object is racist.  I will not display it; I will not sell it.  At the same time, I will not destroy it, because I feel that to do so would be to deny that our society has produced such objects.  It's a real dilemma."
1569,Chief Justice John Roberts Republican Supreme Court began to make the polarization of our Supreme Court more unjudicial as he began the destruction of our democracy eight years ago in Citizens United and Vote Now cases. Many important cases may well be now headed to the Supreme Court. Will his Republican court also become a Trump court and strike another blow to destroy our democracy?
1570,"Like another comment today, I don?t understand the point, is it the death penalty or the make up of the Supreme Court?  If it is a death penalty issue, we should acknowledge that death row inmates have usually committed heinous crimes of sadistic brutality and pain. Having seen their handy work, I am completely devoid of sympathy in any form. They have typically undergone jailhouse conversions, and shed crocodile tears. 

Police photos and pathology reports tell the gruesome truth- mutilation, torture, physical and sexual depravity that is unthinkable. Did their victims suffer, were they shown mercy?  

I understand that others have a different opinion and I have to respect them. However, based on experience, this is mine."
1571,"Ms. Greenhouse presumably has no specific information on this point, so it's understandable that she doesn't bring it up, but I'm more free to wonder if the conservative justices simply were more comfortable with a Buddhist chaplain than with a Muslim chaplain, whether or not they admitted it to themselves."
1572,"I'm confused. Is this article about the death penalty, about the Supreme Court, about individual justices on the court, about religious discrimination, or about polarization in America?"
1573,"Prostitution comes in many varieties.  And the conservatives of the SC are a ? class ? unto themselves.
  Thanks, GOP.   2020."
1574,"The country is polarized only because of the rise of the radical left, the origins of which lie in the previous administration. President Donald J. Trump is doing all that he can do to right the course and unite the nation under a common set of values, pure Anerican values. Now that the witch hunt is over and those who pursued the hunt are indicted and removed from power he be able to complete his mission. I support the President. I support Trump. America first! MAGA! Thank you."
1575,"As we approach fateful decisions, it seems entirely possible that the Trump Administration will ignore plain statutory language requiring it to hand information to Congress--Trump tax returns, Mueller's unredacted report, etc. Lawsuits will then be filed, ultimately reaching the Supreme Court. I fear that the Trump Administration's decisions are being shaped by a belief (that the cases in this article seem to foreshadow) that this Supreme Court will ultimately support Attorney General Barr's support for dictatorship over the Rule of Law."
1576,"Today's Supreme Court justices are a reflection of the presidents who appointed them PERIOD  For good or ill, we depend on this court to uphold the Constitution, not rewrite it in  a particular image or belief system, and protect the country from the impulses of demi-gods.  
Very good article, Ms Greenhouse; I have read your opinions on our courts for years.  Thank you."
1577,"I think that the fiction that Justices ""find"" the law, rather than create it has been unclothed once and for all. 
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch seem to have little patience for doing the work to create the story that there is a precedent for deciding in line with their own prejudices.
It does seem that only Republican appointed Justices seem so brazen."
1578,"It's ironic that a cadre that expresses a zeal that seems religious (faith over facts) would show its cards by imposing cruelty on a Muslim in Alabama (brrr), citing the hall-monitor-like mantra that ""he didn't file his claim on time.""

Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. At the Fed, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain. At the Justice Department, one tired hack after another. And don't get me started about Education or any department tasked with looking after the environment.

How can a Supreme Court that is subject to the whims of Mitch McConnell not eventually wave its bias like a rainbow flag? I think you know the sad answer to your mock-naive question, Linda. We all grieve as we morph into the United States of Mercer and Koch.

Perhaps we will be an object lesson if there is a next time."
1579,"Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Gorsech are not judges in the legal sense, they are right-wing radio talk show hosts who happen to sit on the Supreme Court.
,"
1580,"We might as well get used to Supreme Court decisions made based on religious or political ideology; that's the future for America. With a racist bigot in the White House, and a court stacked with his hand-picked followers, we're in for years of irresponsible and disappointing decisions.

America can blame the president and the court for what we'll be treated to, but the blame rests with us all. It's our own prejudices that have opened the door to what we're now seeing, and it will take a paradigm shift in human thought to right the ship.

In the near future, we will program the human mind in the computer based on a ""survival"" algorithm, which will provide irrefutable proof as to how we trick the mind with our ridiculous beliefs about what is supposed to survive - producing minds programmed de facto for destruction. These minds see the survival of a particular belief as more important than the survival of us all. When we understand all this, we will begin the long trek back to reason and sanity.

1581,"Dumb question! Of course not. But Roberts will try to hold the line on abortion and the ACA in another desperate attempt to hold on to some modicum of respect for the court. But there's only so much one man can do in a room full of Cro-Magnons.

And do you honestly believe that race played no role in these two cases? That's a bit naive, I believe, considering that this is a country ruled by dominant racial and religious tribes."
1582,"The 15-year-old girl Ray killed, and the police officer Murphy killed, did either of them have a spiritual adviser at their side, helping them meet death, or giving them the last rites in their own religion?

Perhaps the easiest answer -- the most equitable, fair, efficient and costly -- is:  meet with your spiritual representatives before the execution.  When your time comes to die though, you are not owed anybody at your side?  As you gave no mercy to the victims, no mercy here is owed to you.

I live in a state where we don't have many murders, so we have agreed that the State does not have the power to take a life because another took a life.  Here, we can use lifelong incarceration to protect others in our society from those who have proven they do not deserve the freedoms to walk freely amongst us or to enjoy the luxuries that free men have.  They can have visitors, of course, including spiritual advisors to help cope with the confinement, which might also make the correctional officials' jobs easier...

Here, two different decisionmakers in the prison in two different regions of the country decided differently.  We have to take these decisions in good faith -- if we start from the basepoint that nothing beyond the basics is owed to men and women who take the lives of others, then you can justify both decisions as acts of mercy.  One man faced his death alone, immediately, as planned.  Another has bought himself a bit of time... The victims got neither. They matter too."
1583,"Even granting your saying Bush vs. Gore was a one off, I think Citizens United & the voiding of the Voter Rights showed that SCTOUS is highly partisan & has been for some time & we are definitely poorer for it."
1584,"The conservative Justices are if the eye for an eye, vengeance is mine, I plike playing god school of ego and jurisprudence. These are not post enlightenment people. Drawing and quartering would be fine by the likes of Alito and the others. As long as they don?t have to dirty their own hands and souls with carrying out the executions. These are people who quite enjoy tinkering with the mechanisms of death."
1585,"The hard-left four are as inflexible as, or perhaps more so than, the hard-right five."
1586,"The 5 hard right majority will rule as a monolithic block on all politically controversial cases. Precedent won?t matter. This is reality. There may be an occasional ideologically charged case that isn?t decided 5-4. Such an anomalous case would arise if the statutory language is so unambiguously clear that only the most blinkered ideologues could ignore the facts. 

Examples of what will happen are briefly mentioned at the end of this excellent piece, such as ending abortion rights in states run by the GOP.  That is unfortunately coming very soon. 

Congratulations to pro-choice voters who supported Trump and other Republicans in 2016 and 2018. You bought this."
1587,"The Supreme Court, in varying degrees throughout its history, has always been another partisan branch of government. Since nominees are selected and confirmed by politicians motivated by their own personal or party interests it is naive to believe otherwise.  The Court is simply Kabuki theater."
1588,"This column was a public service, thank you.

Kavanaugh is going to go down in history as the Justice that most legislated from the bench. He did frequently and egregiously on multiple environmental rulings on the DC circuit, and he will never stop because that is his compulsion.

And of course let us all take a moment to pause to contemplate the authoritarian nature of the audacious utterance ?courts should police carefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay.? 

?Unjustified? more closely describes the SCOTUS than anything I can think of."
1589,"The Supreme Court BELONGS TO the Party that appoints the five-justices -- no more, no less. 

They will support what THEIR PARTY wants  -- no more, no less."
1590,"A defendant ?has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit.?  That is a perfect description of how Trump has operated his entire life.  It's what he claims, and his supporters believe, makes him ?smart?.  Yes, the ?courts should police carefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay.?  But I'm sure that Gorsuch only meant that to apply to a certain kind of criminal."
1591,"The student editorials are thought provoking, poignant and well written, for the most part. The piece by Neha Narayan, while addressing the discrimination LGBT people unjustly face, makes blanket statements like "" White men and women are able to guiltlessly perpetuate beauty standards that benefit them because they?ve been institutionalized--rarely do people question their existence"". To assert or make assumptions against all white men and woman in itself betrays prejudice and is racist. The 'personal story' that was used to begin the piece is actually the story of a man(Homi) as told to the journalist Owen jones and is published in his Nov 2016 opinion piece in the Guardian."
1592,"This article is misleading. It states that ""performance for everyone"" improves when under-performing / poor / urban school students are integrated into wealthy / high-performing / elite / less-diversified public schools. This is simply not true. In reality, many under-performing urban schools lose their top performing students, who often move to better schools - either on merit of need-based scholarships, or on their own, once it becomes clear to them and their family that their potential warrants (and can earn) additional resources. This is part of what creates the ""tracked"" system of public schools. In NYC, the selective public schools like Bronx Science merely formalize this process - weeding out the higher-performers from the lower-performers based on standardized test scores. That's not to say the tax base of a school doesn't affect the quality, it most certainly does. And that's also not to say that Bronx Science students don't benefit from extra funding compared to the schools they leave behind - they certainly do. But it DOES mean that the debate is not so simple as ""everyone improves when you mix them all together."" No matter how you measure diversity, whether by race, or income, or test scores, or anything else - what matters is the academic aptitude of the students sitting in the class rooms (nature or nurture debate irrelevant). Ask any teacher, and they will tell you the same thing - there is a higher track math class and a lower track math class for a reason."
1593,"?The change would include a two mile increase in some bus commutes?. The argument of two miles is too far of an additional commute? Give me a break.

This is not about racial divide; this is about the division of economic prosperity. The oppositions parents are from a diverse set of racial backgrounds: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic. The stark contrast among the opposition and ?minority? families are the income proportions. 

The parents of the opposition of school integration blindly present themselves as privileged families that believe their zip code represents the health of their children?s success; they fear that integration with poverty-stricken students will dilute their sheltered, privileged children?s upbringing, when in reality, it will help prepare them for the real world.

If these parents were so concerned about the allocation of student body demographics and family income, maybe they should send their children to a private school."
1594,"Ms Goldstein states ""A growing body of research suggests that bringing students of disparate races and social classes together can boost children?s test scores and help them develop empathy.""  When I selected the link to see all of this research, I was taken to a site dedicated to integrating schools within Stanford.  That is not a growing body!

After Biden was attacked by Harris during a debate, even the NYTimes had to admit that busing did not work.  It is outrageous to see this happening in the US today.  I would never allow my kids to be bused away from the local schools where we live, were we moved deliberately because of the schools.  

The idea that integration creates empathy is also a joke.  Quite the opposite, especially when disruptive students cannot be punished or removed from a class.  Talk to kids that have gone through this, and stop using data that is collected and analyzed with extreme bias.  

Busing does not work!  What does work is to fund schools equally, hire good teachers, and allow those good teachers to actually teach vs. coddle and discipline the few students in the class that perpetually interrupt class, disrespecting other students and the teacher in the process.  Being black or hispanic doesn't mean you're not as smart as anyone else.  Why is it assumed that having white and asian kids in class with other minorities improves learning for all?  It does not."
1595,"What do other diverse cities like Toronto or London or Frankfurt or Singapore do?

Oh, they have tests every 4 years to match to an ability-level focused ES, MS and HS.   
Oh and A-levels for those who test well enough to move on to the final 2 years of high school.  
Oh, and trade apprenticeships for those who cannot master the academic materials or literacy. 

Here we are bussing kids around to smooth over average test scores and race composition in huge county public school districts.  Did not hear ONE word about how effective the curriculum is, teachers, parental involvement, college or real world readiness, absenteeism, graduation rates, ESOL issues. 

Didn't Milwaukee do Chapter 220 for 20 years and then cancel it? That was a bussing and school choice program."
1596,"What is wrong with mixing everyone together and teaching down to the lowest common denominator? Why should higher-performing students be allowed to excel among themselves, when other students don't have the same ability? This is why highways have speed limits FAR BELOW the speed at which some drivers could safely drive. We don't select the top 30% of drivers and build them their own highways with 100MPH speed limits, do we? No. We make the highways open to all drivers, and we set the speed limit low enough so that the lowest-performing 30% of drivers can most safely get from place to place. Higher-performance drivers might feel disadvantaged, but what is the other option? To leave the lower-performance drivers to take the bus? As a society, we have an obligation to cater ALL SERVICES to the lowest common denominator. And that means ALL SERVICES must be diverse, to ensure that the ""lowest common denominator"" is found equally in all environments. We have a long way to go in this regard. People who resist are the same type of people who want their own personal highway where the speed limit is designed just for them.  Or want their kid in a math class designed to challenge them based on their ability. This is wrong. Services should be for all people, mixed together, always. The slowest among us should govern our pace, and we should accept it."
1597,"This article is a bit one-sided. The ""stiff resistance"" is not because we don't want our schools desegregated. It's because the plan makes no sense. They want to move my kid from the elementary school bordering our neighborhood, to one that takes 15-20 minutes to get to. Both schools have the same demographics, so it wouldn't change anything. National affordable housing expert Rick Jacobus said that a housing plan like Columbia?s, is just focused on downtown renters, and lags behind other affluent suburbs. He notes next-door Montgomery County or across-the-country King County, Washington, are national models that both address the issue across their entire geography. But he acknowledges that such efforts are usually confined to areas near public transportation.  The affordable housing in Howard county is clustered in Columbia. In fact approximately 92% of it is in Columbia. The issue is lack of public transportation among other things in this county. But the point is that of course we now see an imbalance in schools.  I don't think the answer is to disrupt families lives, children need stability. The answer is to solve these design flaws."
1598,If I move into an affluent neighborhood I want my kids to grow up with other like minded parents. It?s just the way it is.
1599,"I  hate segregation.  We are almost as segregated in Cincinnati as we were years ago, far worse than Howard County, it seems.   Some Cincinnati schools have no white children at all!  Others have few blacks.  We have high schools with no AP courses!  But I also hate the busing idea.  Not fair all that travel time.  Nobody would like that!  Wilde Lake does a lot better on AP courses and on the racial mix than certain schools in Cincinnati.  I say Find Other Ways to bring income and racial diversity!  Prosperity for all in this rich -- and poor -- country is what we should work for, it seems to me, not expect the public schools to take all the heat."
1600,"I grew up in Howard County and graduated from Centennial High School ten years ago.  As a woman of color, I could go on and on about the benefits of diversity and why we shouldn't disregard the students of color in Howard County. 
 Instead, I'd like to focus on the racism in the comments section here: it's fascinating reading these comments about parents not wanting their children to attend ""urban"" schools with ""fractured families"" and from ""the wrong side of the tracks.""  Wilde Lake High is a gorgeous school across from an interfaith center and down the street from the Columbia Mall, which is considered the city center.  

Yet, the mere presence of a larger black/latinx community and slightly lower test scores leads NY Times readers from around the country to assume that it's deep in the ghetto.  These racist dogwhistles are the very reason why Howard County leaders need to fight to diversify the schools.  Maybe the NY Times readers could have benefited from similar consideration when they were still attending primary school."
1601,"Sharma is making the argument that his attitude isn?t racist. He also mentioned that he?s a son of Indian immigrants. The caste system/casteism is still rampant in India. It?s probably one of the most racist/discriminatory systems in civilization. Of course, he wouldn?t have any influence from those attitudes."
1602,"""Color blind.""

Not then, not now, not until a very very indefinite futurity."
1603,"What objective, statistical data support the notion that white and Asian kids are helped academically by increasing the numbers of black and Hispanic kids they go to school with?  It has always seemed a left-wing pipe dream."
1604,"Newsflash, even liberals are racist when it comes to protecting any advantages for their own children.  If we want racial economic justice in this country it will mean knocking out some of its inherited entitlements, and will also require a major investment in early education for the disadvantaged. 

It's not rocket science, just sound German engineering.

1605,"That whole article is turned from political games to a racism. Most affected kids are not from very rich families of Asian immigrants. Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, Africans are protesting against cruelty of the County's government, which destroying lives of our kids, moving their away from friends and activities. Just put yourself in their shoes and imagine how stressful it will be for kids to move. The officials, who make those decisions have to be impeached immediately! Because they go against their voters, taxpayers and against our future - our kids."
1606,"I have taught at Wilde Lake High for over 20 years. My own child is a proud graduate of Wilde Lake, and many local teachers enroll their own children here. Teachers know Wilde Lake is Columbia's best kept secret. And as a member of the Maryland Professional Standards Board for teachers, I also know that Howard County attracts the very best qualified teachers in the state, and there are no bad schools in Columbia. Additionally, Wilde Lake's demographic diversity is its greatest strength, as our student body represents the widest economic range in the county, and includes students from 80 nations speaking over 40 languages. My own kid got a wonderful education here, as will the new students we enroll next year. We will welcome them and their families into our Wilde Lake community and enjoy their discovery of the rich educational opportunities we provide. 
While we look forward to restoring neighborliness in our vibrant community, I do think many people in Howard County enjoyed the WildeCat football team's upset of the River Hill Hawks in the 3A state playoffs last week. Welcome to the Wilde side, Hawks!"
1607,"""Longer commutes to school, they argued, would mean less time for students to do homework and to sleep. Some children would be severed from friends they had made in earlier grades. Low-income parents with inflexible jobs would be hit the hardest, and would not be able to get involved in their children?s schools.""

I'm sympathetic to this argument. There's a private school down the road from us that's on my way to work, has small class size and a lot of kids from our neighborhood feed into it. I don't look forward to paying the tuition but the other mid school/high school is out of my work way and we don't live close to that neighborhood. There's a beautifully built public school but it's the same size as when it was built: 1950s. They've packed the kids in there. 


Sometimes I think all this fighting could be quieted by building more schools within neighborhoods. Parents would like their kids to go to schools close by in their neighborhoods with lots of room to handle new kids each semester."
1608,"Desegregation is a good idea.  It will help keep our communities strong and our democracy vibrant.  However, to achieve it by busing kids around is not a good idea.  More mixed income housing with better job opportunities with better pay is the answer.  Everything comes back to economic inequality."
1609,"Want to destroy the public school system?  Force kids into bussing,  All schools will lose families that can afford a private education.  Who wants their kids spending hours a day travelling to and from schools?"
1610,I think parents of children in better-performing schools are really afraid of transferring students being  disruptive or not interested learning. The fears stem from time taken away from teaching/learning to disciplining.
1611,"Ah yes.  The bob and weave of white fragility begins as evidenced by many of the comments on this thread.  But let's be real.  The parents who push against long bus rides wouldn't be sounding that alarm if the destination were a fancy private school with a fair complexion.  Consider the message we send to our kids, white and black, when we are complicit with segregation."
1612,"I hope this controversy will show Liberals everywhere how misguided they are. These are people who would normally see racism and white privilege in EVERY racially lopsided outcome. But they have a very different view when they see the situation up close. 

With first-hand experience they see that higher test scores are a result of a competitive environment where parents (of any color) are pushing their kids and the schools to do better. Invoking ""segregation"" as the culprit just minimizes the real segregation that people suffered in the past.

As in most cases, forced diversity is just optics. Real change has to come from within one's own community and culture."
1613,"River Hill is the ONLY village in Columbia without affordable housing.  (There are 10 villages in Columbia.)  The lack of housing diversity in River Hill goes against the values which Rouse set forth for Columbia a little over 50 years ago.  Ironically, River Hill is finally slated to build affordable housing yet the superintendent's plan has this polygon going to an elementary school with a high FARM rate.  There is a lot more to this story than kids being sent to WLHS from RHHS.  This is a very small portion of the students potentially being moved.  I wish Ms. Goldstein focused more on the impact of developer's campaign donations over the past few decades.  Politicians continue to be influenced by developers while putting aside the impact to the community.  As Andy from Vermont said, as long as housing in America is segregated, public schools will suffer."
1614,"As long as housing in America is segregated by race and class then the public schools will struggle to accomplish their mission of providing an equitable education to all American children. We continue to reap the consequences of red-lining, suburban flight, gated communities and other methods of separating Americans from one another. Jonathan Kozol wrote about this problem with his book 'Savage Inequalities'. Is a beloved community still possible where we live together, work together, play together and go to school together?"
1615,Nothing better than seeing liberal hypocrisy at work. And also a note to the ?education experts?.  Placing students from different communities side by side only works if they are of the same academic level. Otherwise the segregation continues at the level of the school class. Note I did not say dumb down the academics nor intermix smart and dumb in the same class. First bring up the academic achievement in the ?poor? schools by providing remedial programs. This must include discipline for the incorrigible and removal of the mentally handicapped from mainstream classes. You may then find that forced busing is neither needed nor desirable. Long bus rides and social isolation are not a myth. They are harmful. Why so much youth obesity? Look no farther than long bus rides for dubious social engineering purposes.
1616,"There are several reforms currently underway in education that make parent's more wary of integration plans.

1st are the discipline reforms.  Someone did a single-factor regression (variable was race) and found that minority kids were suspended or expelled more often (they didn't run regressions on single parenthood or trauma a child may have experienced).  Policy-makers attribute discipline to race rather than class disruption.  The proposed solution, so far, has been to relax discipline.  Which means that less learning can occur in a classroom if kids are allowed to disrupt the entire classroom, 1 student can diminish the learning of an entire class.

2nd is the movement to eliminate gifted programs or selective enrollment programs, usually based on similar social goals.  Now, if students are unprepared for class (algebra teachers have to spend time on basic math concepts, slowing down the advancement of the rest of the algebra class), they slow down the progress of the rest of the class.  

It is natural for a parent to have concerns about putting their kids in a sociological experiment, one where the results won't be known for 20 years.  It is biology to care more about your own child than a neighbors, and trying to force parents to put aside the concern for their own genetic descendants is not going to end well.  A lion will protect her own cub more fiercely than another cub in the pride."
1617,"Unlike many families, politics is not spoken of a lot in my house. The reason? I?m not sure. When hearing my friends debate and speak on issues I often feel left out, because quite frankly, I don?t know much. I wish I had a greater understanding and more knowledge so I can be an active participant in a conversation. But, if there?s one thing I do know about politics, its that the left and the right rarely listen to what the other side has to say. Most polititians have blinders on, so if you don?t totally agree with them, you?re against them.
So when I saw a political story on climate change I was interested because it is a perfect example of this ?with us or against us? idea. Mr. Galloway said it perfectly, ?Climate change isn?t going to discriminate between red states and blue states, so red-state actors have to start engaging on these issues.? I was shocked to read that Republicans deliberately deny scientific facts just to not agree with the other side.
In order to sustain life on earth as we know it, compromises are going to have to be made. According to the article younger Republicans believe ?Nearly 60 percent of Republicans between the ages of 23 and 38 say that climate change is having an effect on the United States, and 36 percent believe humans are the cause. That?s about double the numbers of Republicans over age 52.? I was happy to hear that the younger generations are more open to learning new things and hearing other opinions. This could mean a bright future."
1618,"I'm not convinced by this argument, or at least not by the headline.  Athens was a ""democracy? and had slaves.  It's confusing two different things, the form of Government and the degree of equality.  It's essentially propaganda."
1619,"This is an elegantly-presented one-sided diatribe I have heard many times before.

Or as Rep. Ayanna Pressley so famously said recently, ""?If you?re not prepared to come to that table and represent that voice, don?t come, because we don?t need any more brown faces that don?t want to be a brown voice. We don?t need black faces that don?t want to be a black voice.? 

I grew up in an area which experienced white flight and forced busing. There was no separate facilities for blacks and whites, except the ones established by the black kids at school, like black-only cafeteria tables. 

Ms. Hannah-Jones's narrative did not reflect my reality. When black kids shamed other black kids for volunteering in class as ""acting white,"" it never made sense.

But the library was open to all. And black and white kids who used it, excelled.

My black football coach was an excellent counter-point to Hannah-Jones. He did not suffer any excuses from any player, white or black. He was a role model for me and I miss him. He was a proud veteran, too. No kid would dare call him a ""Tom,"" or that his ""voice wasn't Black enough."" 

I'm fairly certain that even some white Europeans struggled and died here. A few of them hail from Appalachia, didn't own slaves, and brought the coal out of the Earth for two centuries under dire conditions.

But that story would ruin the single lens focus of this article beholden to identity politics. And I'm not claiming or checking any so-called ""privilege"" at the door."
1620,"1.  The world?s first anti-slavery society was founded in Philadelphia before 1776, so America didn?t invent slavery but did invent its abolition.  2.  The American Revolution certainly did not occur because the Founders wanted to protect the slave trade from being abolished by Britain, and the Constitution allowed for federal ban of the slave trade by 1808.  3.  The Founders were virtually all strongly anti-slavery though not anti-racist per social norms of the era (read No Property in Man by Princeton historian Sean Wilencz).  4. Most northern states abolished slavery shortly after the founding of the United States.  5.  The cotton gin?s invention by Eli Whitney, which vastly increased the value of the enslaved, could not have been anticipated by the anti-slavery Founders who sought to contain slavery to the South and let it die out gradually.  6.  Slavery and racism were atrocious enough without distorting and embellishing the historical record as this author has done."
1621,"If we're not careful we're going to tear this country apart. Civil rights leader Andrew Young has warned that the left's obsession with relitigating America's racist past is a terrible mistake. He said that it's ""too costly to refight the Civil War. We have paid too great a price in trying to bring people together."" He's right. Initiatives like this preach only to the converted & will accomplish nothing. Most people will be revolted by progressives trying to reframe the founding of this country as 1619 instead of 1776. Slavery was a horrible crime. We all know that. But the perpetrators have been dead for centuries. It is beyond outrageous to try to guilt or hold responsible millions of Americans for the sins of the past injustices. Someone, please explain to me how my grandfather a Polish immigrant who arrived here in 1920 is culpable for any of these atrocities. I don't feel the need to atone for sins committed by people I have never seen or who are separated by hundreds of years of genealogy, What the far left is demanding is more than mere historical revisionism, though. They demand that you see this country exactly as they do, reach the same moral judgments about it, & confess your sins. That's not happening, ever. The left has become self-righteous & obsessed with trivial issues that have made them a national laughing stock. The people leading this movement are irrational fanatics. We have work to do but we can't go down this road. It will just breed resentment."
1622,"The problem with sowing division along racial lines, as this article seeks, is that it succeeds.

The narrative that hard work did not achieve success is true for many people, of all colours and nationalities!  It is not the reserve of black people.  

I'm sorry to say this but if people just moved on with their lives instead of constantly using their race as some kind of badge for the downtrodden then we would all be better off.  Life is tough, as it was for most of our forefathers. The world does not owe you anything.  Make the best of it."
1623,"To say that ?Our democracy?s founding ideals were false when they were written? is grossly untrue; it is bogus historical revisionism. With all due respect to Ms. Hannah-Jones, she commits the fallacy of judging historical figures of the distant past by the standards of our own time and place, not the standards of the time and place of the historical figures. On July 4, 1776?given the way the world was on that date, not today?s date?what our Founding Fathers were doing was mind-blowingly radical and progressive; it was a display of courage that was insane in its boldness, it was courage that today?s progressives can?t ever match. On July 4, 1776, our Founding Fathers committed treason against a king who commanded the most powerful army and navy on planet earth, they put their necks in the hangman?s noose, a noose they knew would snap their necks if their rebellion failed. To complain that the phrase ?all men are created equal? was not sufficiently inclusive of all demographic groups on July 4, 1776 is a quibble that ignores the reality of the world as it was on that date. Our American ideals had to start somewhere and the start our Founding Fathers made on July 4, 1776 was magnificent, it changed the world. All groups who have been added to the phrase ?all men? in subsequent generations of our history?former slaves, women, gays?owe absolute gratitude to the Founding Fathers of all of us for starting the ball rolling on the American ideal in such heroic fashion."
1624,"From the Middle Passage to the Black Mediterranean
As we commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Landing Negroes at Jamestown, it is imperative to note that what happened four centuries ago can happen again. The Emancipation Proclamation was the USA?s most meaningful Mea Culpa for its original sin. But the Middle Passage (MP) has been followed by the Black Mediterranean. The Africans' predicament during the Middle Passade was inconsistent with the American ideal of liberty. For Africans, modern-day slavery is apparent in the Black Mediterranean or their tragic experience in the Mediterranean basin.  To improve their predicament, they have tried to reach Europe. They have gone through racial violence in Morocco and Libya before the deadly crossing of the Sea to reach Europe. Their predicament is reminiscent of the Middle Passage. Many Africans spend a rough transit time in Libya and Morocco. They pay big money to smugglers who transport them to Europe. According to the International Organization for Migration, some Africans are sold by their captors in slave markets in Libya, ?Where Africans are auctioned for $400? (CNN 2017). According to The Guardian, more than 180,000 people were rescued from the Mediterranean and taken to Italy in 2016. IOM put the number of deaths at 1,650. The rise of nationalists in Europe has increased xenophobia, with dire consequences for African migrants. 
May the 400th anniversary be a moment to condemn slavery as a crime against humanity."
1625,"I'm 62 years old and white. I was born in a small town in Texas and spent my first 18 years there. 
In my public grade school they taught us about Reconstruction. They taught us that it was a shameful period in which illiterate and incompetent black people were briefly given the power to serve in positions of authority, and that this state of affairs persisted until white Southerners were able to put it right. 
It was so profoundly racist it's hard for me to grasp it. It's stunning to me now that teachers stood in front of the classroom and told children these lies. 
This was a beautiful article and I'm grateful that the Times ran it."
1626,"As the daughter of a man born in 1913 on a Sharecropping farm in N. Carolina and also a WWII Veteran, this article made me so proud. We are given the side eye by both White America and Black America if we act too patriotic.  One because they believe this is not our ture country and the other because we are treated as outsiders to this country, why claim it .I am also the granddaughter of a runaway Virginian who fought in the Civil War. And the many great-granddaughter of a white man who fought in the Revolution.  If anyone is America, Ain't I ?"
1627,How far have we come? Look at who is occupying the White House.
1628,"Wow! Is all I can say. Thank you for a lesson, so sorely needed."
1629,"Wow, thank you to the NYT for this issue and shedding a bright light on a topic to long inn the shadows and unspoken.  For the digest time ever, I read the magazine cover to cover, every word. I learned more about US history than in all my years at school and was completely humbled both by the content and the beauty of the writing. Thank you."
1630,Absolutely awesome!
1631,"Wow!  This piece is stunning.  The Bible says the truth will set us free.  It is my hope that the truths in this story are received and built upon.  It is not our desire to make villains of Whites.  It is our desire to reclaim them as brothers and sisters in humanity.  There is little to gain by our continued choosing of ""sides.""  Sides are a false narrative based on a bed of lies.  Unity is the price of freedom for us all."
1632,"Ms. Jones, thank you for writing this article which brilliantly outlines the the African American experience in this country and the credit we deserve for making this democracy authentic.  I would also add that just like the enslaver did not fully believe in the ideals of democracy they crafted neither did they believe in the ideals of Christianity they promoted."
1633,"I was entranced reading the essay.  It filled in some gaps in black history for me. The only history taught in elementary school during my era (1950-1965) was stemmed around colonial times, and there was no mention of black people, except Harriet Tubman, just a mention.  You only hear about the year 1776, which is espoused by main-stream writers.  While reading, I experienced several emotions, anger, sadness, pride and elation.  My forebears suffered as a people and were subjugated to the point of being killed.  Unfortunately, this is still happening today.  The incarceration of the black men, especially, is astronomical, especially on minor charges.  I do believe that fear causes actions in the extreme,  in preventing black men from reaching theirs is accomplished through jailing or killing them.  But I have undying faith in my brethren, nothing can stop the will and achievement of a people who have been strong since 1619.  I believe you said it is in our DNA."
1634,"Thank you, Ms. Hannah-Jones, for your outstanding article in the Magazine last weekend.  As a baby boomer white woman living in the north, I have struggled to understand our country today. I feel I don't belong here.  But, your excellently-written article shed new light on my confusion. Thank you for the historical perspective and insightful correlations between what kind of country we are now and where we have come from.  It is gravely discouraging and imminently hopeful all at once.  I am a glass half full kind of a gal, and I want to believe that in 200 years, we as a nation will have found more tolerance and kindness.  I just wish it would happen quicker."
1635,"A very interesting article, but it seems to be somewhat U.S. centric.  Less than 10% of the Western Hemisphere African slave trade was to North America, perhaps as low as 5%.  Chattel slavery existed in Africa and parts of the Americas before European immigration to the Americas.  A broader discussion of the impacts of slavery on those countries that sold slaves and those that bought slaves from the slave traders would have helped give a clearer understanding of the impacts in the U.S.  

If slavery caused the U.S. to develop in a certain manner then those characteristics should be seen in other countries that had slavery, but if those characteristics are not seen in these other countries then did slavery truely cause them in the U.S."
1636,"2nd try

Slavery in what became the United States may date from 1619, but it is one of the most ancient institutions in the world. One of the places where slavery thrived -- and in pockets survives to this very day -- is Africa. Slavery runs in the DNA of Africans as it does in everyone else's.

Hannah-Jones does not help her credibility by skirting the role that Africans played in America's slavery. As James Horn says in his book (""1619: Jamestown ...."") the ""capture and sale of human beings was not introduced by Europeans -- it was embedded in African culture and consequently had a long history -- but the alliance [of African rulers] with Portuguese merchants greatly expanded it....""

The vast majority of the ""12.5 million Africans [who] would be kidnapped from their homes and brought in chains across the Atlantic Ocean"" were kidnapped by other Africans and brought across the Atlantic by Europeans and Americans.

I don't know if American slavery was uniquely awful. The history of man's inhumanity to man is so full of crimes that I wouldn't know how to begin to categorize them. But since I came to the US many years ago, I have never met anyone who tried to minimize or excuse that shameful part of our nation's story.

But I do know that England and America were unique in one extraordinary respect. They abolished slavery. No discussion of slavery is complete without mentioning that -- and the fact that almost half a million Union soldiers laid down their lives to end slavery."
1637,"Great journalism, just one piece missing; TUSKEGEE!"
1638,"This enlightening essay deserves the highest praise.  We can never understand our present state without learning about our past, because without this knowledge, we cannot properly commit to ensuring change.  Others complain about this knowledge sowing racial division, but I see it as bringing understanding.  Unfortunately, what I understand most is that the denial of the past is the source for the continued support for white privilege and racial injustice.  The path to a more perfect union begins in proper education, and this story is desperately needed to be in the text books."
1639,"There's a gesture that Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" makes during his summation to the all-white jury.  He's describing Bob Ewell's desire to put from his own mind the knowledge of what he has done--the abuse, the soul-murder, the cruelty--to his daughter, May Ella.  Facing the immutable jury of white men, Atticus tells them that Tom's gesture of sympathy toward May Ella in entering the Ewell's yard and chopping up the chifforobe for her had overwhelmed Bob Ewell with guilt and shame for what he himself had done (and not done), so much so that he just wanted to ""put it all behind him"".  As he utters these words, Peck's Atticus sweeps his hands violently past his thighs as if paddling them through snake-filled water.  Peck's gesture in that film captured what for me is a truth about why white people such as myself find it so difficult to acknowledge, much less redress, the systemic violence and terrorism of our European forebears toward black people.  As Tom does for Bob Ewell, black people serve for us (or can) as living reminders of our complicity in and tacit sanction of the Founding Sin of our nation.  400 years.  Accepting as truth that there can be no forgiveness without first acknowledging and understanding what it is that needs to be forgiven, I'd like to offer thanks to Ms. Hannah Jones Mr. Trymaine Lee and all of the individuals involved in this timely and vital project.  You're holding up the torch... and the mirror."
1640,"I admire this essay and its clarity, accuracy and power. I would add only that the genocide and repeated treachery and violence against First Peoples is of equal significance to the American story. I would not put one above the other, as some have suggested; we don't have to choose, because both of these stories were the essential beginning of the American story. Consider that all -- ALL -- of the lands worked by enslaved peoples were first stolen by deceit or violence from First Peoples. ALL. That along should be enough to convince anyone that these two stories need to be told side by side, and that both are incomplete without the other."
1641,"Wow.  Just wow.  A dispassionate, clear, concise path through history that connects all of the dots that we have never been taught.  Thank you for this article. Thank you for this project. My eyes are seeing something new."
1642,Men like Justice Stevens just don't seem to exist anymore.Women are our best hope.
1643,"Bold, determined and independent-minded is a chief characteristic of the greatest generation to which Justice John Paul Stevens belongs. Some lived even further with other evolving and holistic standards, one that U2 summaries in their recent song ?13?: ?Are you strong enough to be kind??

U.S. Constitutional Framer and 3rd American President Thomas Jefferson constructed the first wall to protect The United States of America from a clear pattern of destruction in nations, countries and empires since Rome and beyond. Justice Stevens  illuminated red glares on that wall again in 1995 in his dissent to Justice Scalia?s Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board opinion:

?[T]he sequence of sectarian displays disclosed by the record in this case illustrates the importance of rebuilding the ?wall of separation between church and State? that Jefferson envisioned.?

To family, friends, colleagues and community members of Justice Stevens, I send deep condolences. For the many of us who have read Justice Stevens and any of his counsel-inspired opinions and dissents, including others about religion, Justice Stevens remains held as sacred. 

Rest In Peace, in or around the 1st protective wall."
1644,"Well, just to be clear, ""pellucid (ly)"" means clear.  What ""clearly clear"" might mean, I am not sure. I am reasonably certain, however, that Kavanaugh is qualified, and that the charge of some sort of prejudice as regards the Federalist Society is wrong, although his appointment might not be in the best interests of the United States, but of that I am unsure. I highly value (the deceased) Judge Stevens' premium placed upon learning as an important, integral part of life experience. Juxtaposing that with changes in the status quo such as ""Citizens United"" is troubling, but when one considers the role played by fads in this country, such troubling thoughts are mollified, and the identification of this trend as a fad, somewhat nullifies the trouble taken to consider it in such a harsh light. True some people are malleable with money as the dominant agent; take Trump's supporters, for instance. Corporate money, however, won't exhibit such agent-like qualities as a promoter of behavior which might be termed the object of operant conditioning, or so I think."
1645,"?I am prepared,? the former [Republican] president [Ford] wrote, ?to allow history?s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court.?

A good Executive can serve a heavy dose of humility to a streak of male Executive follies. 

A good Justice can ?assert... a muscular brand of judicial authority? while co-serving women and men. 

Thank you Linda and editors for this right to co-serve some writing with you on this day."
1646,I find no better retort against ageism than Justice Stevens's dissenting argument against Citizens United at the age of 90. One can only hope to have as fascinating and influential existence as he did.
1647,"Justice Stevens, as he himself said, was not a liberal.  He described himself as a conservative and that, in the traditional and historical sense, is what he was.

The United States Supreme Court is presently made up of five right wing ideologues and four moderates.  To attempt to describe the Court in any other fashion is a gross injustice."
1648,"Justice Stevens was brilliant with a moral compass that was always pointing to true north. And as a University of Chicago undergraduate and Northwestern Law School alumnus, it was refreshing and important to have someone other than the Ivy League  army on the high court."
1649,"Stevens was one of the greatest Justices in the history of our country.  A man born to great wealth and privilege who was able to understand the position of the powerless and voiceless.  When he attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, one of his closest friends was Jewish.  Stevens always said that having a front-row seat for the constant anti-Semitic abuse hurled at his friend taught him empathize with the oppressed and to hate discrimination.

Of course he made mistakes.  He was a human being.  What made him so great, as Greenhouse points out, is that he always wanted to learn -- to do better, to understand better, to judge better.  That kind of intellectual humility is one of the key attributes of a great judge.  A far cry from the moralistic certitude of a Scalia, a Thomas or a Kavanaugh.

He was a giant.  I do not expect to see his equal during my lifetime."
1650,May all Supreme Court Justices and all Judges became enlightened and ever more compassionate like Justice Stevens.  What a gift he was to our world!  Blessings to his family.
1651,"Another great American, good ol' President Lincoln, once said: ""Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.""

Justice Stevens, you passed with flying colors."
1652,Would that the present SCOTUS were blessed with 9 John Paul Stevens; the U.S. and the World would be far better off if that were the case. R.I.P. good and faithful servant!
1653,"He lived in Fort Lauderdale?  When I was in Chicago on his birthday last year, I called a ""John P Stevens"" whom I found in the phone book to offer best wishes.  Not surprising he didn't respond.  RIP, Justice Stevens!"
1654,"Five will get you ten that when Trump was informed of Steven's death, he said: 

""Oh good!  Now I get to appoint another judge to the court.""  

More seriously, Stevens was the sort of judge the court SHOULD be composed of."
1655,"And so we're left with Silent Clarence (unless there's a Coke can around), ""I Love Beer "" Kavanaugh, Stolen Seat Gorsuch, the rigorous, steadfast and skilled Ginsberg, Sotomayer, Breyer and Kagan, and the ""which-way-is-the-wind-blowing-today"" dynamic duo of Roberts and Alito. God help us all."
1656,"A man who did not understand he was a judge, not a politician making policy, using the extended perquisites of the former to impose unaccountable social policy on the country; a man who warped the meaning of the Constitution to meet his standards, and then called them the Constitution's; a man who, like the President who nominated him, were just too small for the offices they acquired."
1657,"It's nice to read an obituary that tells such a wonderful story, filling in details about the person in question both from a factual standpoint and from who they were, as a personality.

Linda Greenhouse did a fantastic job on a fantastic Supreme Court Justice. We will likely never see a justice as evenhanded as he again."
1658,"I'm not surprised that Citizens' United was the last straw for the great Associate Justice, John Paul Stevens. Everyone should read Six Amendments. It's short and he's right.

Citizens' United was one of the worst decisions in American history, and the five justices who voted on the incorrect side should hang their heads in shame.

5-4 decisions for matters of this import are horrendous. It may never happen. But, it would be better to have 10 justices, so that close decisions lead to a draw, referral back to the lower court. If the result of a very controversial decision doesn't have a 2 vote margin, aka 6 to 4, SCOTUS shouldn't make such a decision at all."
1659,"We are still stuck with FEC vs United, a terrible decision.  Just on climate change, very wealthy oil and chemical corporations are intent on wreaking the planet for profit, while buying votes any which way they can in Red states.  Corporations have limited liability, unlike everyone else, who must pay for the consequences of their (protected) wrongdoing.  Corporations also have the most money, making it easy for candidates who take their money to represent them, rather than the citizens described in the Constitution who vote.

The anti-trust laws haven't been enforced since Reagan, and less so since we have had majorities put in by the corporations.  Also quid pro quo contributions, which are illegal.  No prosecution of AT&T recently for an obvious bribe to affect a merger, the bribe paid to Cohen-Trump."
1660,"The obituary reminds us that a capacity for humility might best describe this justice -- along with the ability to evolve, to respond with humanity, empathy and common sense while retaining a deep appreciation that the Constitution is a guiding and living document. Are these qualities lost on us in this new historical moment? We are at a loss without such a justice."
1661,"Justice John Paul Stevens has been an American hero and exemplar, upholding the integrity of our Constitution and embodying our desire to perfect democracy and equality.

I shall remember Justice Stevens for his opinions in Bush v. Gore, Heller and Citizens United.  In these opinions, he represented the many Americans unhappy to see the Constitution interpreted in ways that we consider overly political or ideological.  Justice Stevens confirmed in his dissents that Constitutional interpretation had a nobler history that we reject at our peril. 

I shall also remember Justice Stevens for his book detailing suggested revisions to the Constitution, proposing common sense changes such as the elimination of gerrymandering.  The changes suggested by Justice Stevens were aimed at strengthening American democracy, something that has been in scant supply in recent decisions dominated by the Court?s conservative wing.

Profound thanks to John Paul Stevens for his service to our nation.  And profound thanks to the late Gerald Ford for nominating Justice Stevens to the Supreme Court."
1662,"There will never be another John Paul Stevens.  Each person brings to the world a combination of traits that cannot be exactly duplicated, but we can hope for someone to serve on our Supreme Court who will bring the qualities of intelligence, integrity, reflection, flexibility, and depth of inquiry that we were blessed to have in Justice Stevens' service to the court.

His passing is a loss not only to his family, but to all of us who benefited from his voice on the Supreme Court."
1663,"What a wonderful man! A FAIR and JUST judge, who could THINK and DISCERN what was best for our nation! Wow! Amazing! I hope that Roberts, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Alito and Thomas take note! The Supreme Court should not be partisan, they should uphold, defend and protect our Constitution and Laws. 

Rest in peace dear Justice Stephens, thank you for being FAIR and JUST!"
1664,"Truly, it is fascinating. Conservatives and Republicans ?evolve,? which means they go left, while the ?lefties? only evolve by becoming even more lefty.

Roberts is the new ?evolver.?"
1665,And the Republican politicians in robes that we have today aren't fit to clean his bathroom.
1666,And now we have Kavanaugh. What a world.
1667,"Wow. Several of these are as good as I've seen from any photographer, anywhere."
1668,honestly I think that photo that spoke to mean the most was the one taken by Joshua Baker because I completely agree with him because we use our electronics does not  mean we are reliant on them and it keeps us connected with friends and family and lets us spread ideas.
1669,"The photo taken by Fatimah Ardennes Fernandez spoke to me personally because I, too, feel as if college is coming very soon, and because of that I feel as close to my friends as ever. Furthermore, William Hohe's photo spoke to me because of its sense of having fun and enjoying one's youth. I too believe that teenagers should prioritize this, and the photo depicted it quite well."
1670,"what a beautiful picture[s] of our often misunderstood young ones, from all over the world. 
we have left myriad burdens on them. but I see here how they are facing them. 
they are our future."
1671,"The picture by Alison Tong speaks to me the most. Being a high school student isn't easy. We all have a bunch of homework we have to complete each night and on top of that we have to study for the one or multiple quizzes or tests we have each day. I am a Freshmen in High school, so I just getting used to what the teachers expect from me and the amount of work we have to get done all in one night. This photo is showing a boy who is obviously overwhelmed with a bunch of homework and studying to do. He has a bunch of books around him and he is sleeping on top of those books with ink all over his face because he is so tired. I relate to this person a lot because I also get stressed out and tired when it come to homework. But, when you think about it and you get used to it, it isn't so bad. Thong says at a young age we all got it drilled into our heads that there is a specific path to follow for success. She also says that all high school students have a packed schedule and a bunch of homework to do that we have no room for ourselves. I one hundred percent agree with her on this statement."
1672,"The picture by William Hohe struck me the most. I love being reminded that as teenagers, we are allowed to do things just because. It's okay for us to want adventure, to not have a reason for what we do, to do things for fun. These teenage years are so important, and it is critical that we are allowed a degree of freedom to find ourselves, what we love, and who we are. Overbearing parents can put a damper on these years rather than giving children the freedom that we need.  While technology can help in this process, it is important to get off of social media and explore the world with people that matter to and support us."
1673,"The photograph taken by Alison Tong speaks for itself before you reach the small paragraph. At first, the photo seems confusing and somewhat scary, but then you start to recognize the words written on the person's face. After reading the explanation after, Tong does capture what it's like for everyone and how it truly is ""drilled into our minds from a young age"" that there has to be a specific path for success. This photo captures this expectation amazingly."
1674,The photo by sunhyung lee speaks to me personally the most because she has a strong relationship with her grandmother. When i was younger I used to stay over my nana's house every weekend and it'd be a special thing to do. IN the morning we would make pancakes with my papa and then play board games and go outside. It was one of the best parts of my childhood and although i still may not do it that frequently today we still hold a strong relationship even though we are from different generations. This picture shows how difference in generations can have no effect on any relationships. Although older people may say we rely on technology and it is an addiction it can still be used in a fun way such as bonding with your grandmother.
1675,"The photo by Alison Tong speaks to me personally being a senior in high school. All the pressure of being the best to have a rigorous resume for college applications and for the real-world is all-consuming. As we strive to be the perfect students and perfect people, we lose ourselves in the process. This image represents my generation greatly as we put all our effort into everything, but we weaken ourselves mentally, emotionally, and physically. Sleep deprivation becomes our norm and stress and anxiety become our constant emotional state. For me, my education means everything. However, like this boy pictured it has cost me effects on my mental health and physical health. Adults put this pressure on us to be perfect, but there's no such thing. As the pressure grows and grows, all you'll have left is a shell of a growing human being who is only trying to succeed and thrive in a society where perfection is deemed to be the norm."
1676,"I wish to thank the NYT for giving young people a platform on which to express themselves, verbally and visually. As the mother of one of the winners I am of course very proud, but especially touched by the creativity, sincerity, and emotion which went into each and every contribution. Let's support this generation as best we can, beyond this delicate phase and into adulthood. They deserve it."
1677,"This is such a beautiful portrayal of our children globally and what goes through their minds. I learn something new about them every day. These portraits present invaluable perspectives of Generation Z. Each portrait published here, makes me understand better yet another behavioral aspect of my own children - one 17, another 20. This is another generation, growing up in another time, with another set of challenges and opportunities. Great work, NYT!"
1678,"I agree with Savannah.  Also, I was struck by how articulate these students are, and how much they care."
1679,What a beautiful and diverse picture of what Generation Z is truly about. Congratulations to these kids for speaking their truth and helping redefine what us adults think about them. It would be wonderful to see the full gallery of all the winners and finalists.
1680,"Intellectual dishonesty flows through this article. The 2015 women's world cup brought in $73 million in revenue. The men's world cup brought in $6 billion. 

The women's world cup is *expected* to bring $131 million during this cycle but not even 2.5% of the men's revenue. 

True equality would mean the men get a raise while the women slash their pay."
1681,"Women?s soccer is a third tier sport in the US, like men?s lacrosse, track and field (men?s and women?s), professional beach volley ball and Nordic skiing.  The pay is, logically, similar."
1682,"The women soccer players play more games and have greater attendance.  Therefore,as entertainers, they should be paid more than the men.  In tennis, however, women play less games and have less attendance.  They also seek equal pay."
1683,"If pay were based on ability, women soccer players wouldn't merit more than a minor league's men team. Although the best in the world in comparison to other women's team, the U.S. women's team is not even as fast or strong or dangerous as the worst MLS team, which is far from the best men's league in the world. But sheer athletic ability is the wrong way to frame the pay argument for the U.S. women's team. In this case sport is best understood as entertainment, and on those terms the U.S. women's team draws tv audiences equal to many men's games and more than the U.S. men's team, which, even though it would wipe out the women in a head-to-head match, are nowhere near as compelling when it comes to American viewers. In other words, the women have an argument, and I say this as someone who finds the sport excruciatingly boring."
1684,"Here we have the usual exaggerations backing feminist whines for equal pay: female players are ""superstars"", they make as many sacrifices as men, and they play ""better"". 

The same people would advance that if a female employee in a sales department puts in the same hours as a male , but only brings in 10% of the revenue he does, she should still be paid the same and be called a ""hero"" because of the hours she spends failing to catch up. 
Likewise, the kids in the local minor league team aren't as rich as the top major league players because nobody is going to pay to watch them play, while millions will to watch ML baseball.

No, male and female leagues do NOT ""play the same"", and with regards to the gender pay gap, do not create the same revenue. People buy tickets or watch TV to see men play, because they play at an extremely competitive level. US Soccer women play perhaps at the level of a local amateur men's team at best. 
To claim that the US women's team plays better than the men's team because they win against comparatively mediocre female players while the men play in an incomparably competitive league is a mendacious distortion of logic. The reason there IS a women's league is that if teams were coed AND fully competitive, there would be no pro women players at all. It follows that the moneymaker in the business, the power to sell tickets & merchandise and garner rights & ad revenue, disproportionately rewards men. 

Want to be paid the same? Make the same revenue."
1685,"I wonder about this.  The American women's team is successful because there is vastly less competition in women's than men's soccer.  If they played the men, they would lose badly. So why precisely do they deserve to be paid the same amount?  Wouldn't it make more success to move toward a model of gender-neutral soccer, and let the best players succeed regardless of their sex?"
1686,"So the women generate the vast majority of the revenue for the US Soccer Federation and get paid a fraction of their worth?  This is ridiculous from a business and moral perspective.  To the hundreds of thousands of parents out there with girls in soccer, start tweeting at US Soccer's sponsors like Secret, Coca-Cola, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Deloit , Volkswagon, PowerAide, Cutter and more. Get loud. <a href=""https://www.ussoccer.com/sponsors-and-partners"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ussoccer.com/sponsors-and-partners</a>"
1687,I think that it is up to the sponsors. Nike and Coke should at least be paying the World Cup Champions the big bucks.
1688,"Be careful what you wish for. This Is a sport that in the US is played by mostly suburban young women who, like the rest of their generation male and female, have been brought up with high expectations about their self-worth. US national team members already reap rewards beyond those of nearly any other women's team sport anywhere in the world. I am in Latin America right now and can tell you that the women?s World Cup commands much less media interest than ?lesser? men?s completions such as the Copa Oro, Copa America, ?boys? U20, or European national team completions. Should nations down here, or in say Africa, ever succeed in devoting the resources to their women that we do in the US, it is highly probable that the current US women?s team success in an unbalanced playing field will be viewed as something of an aberration in hind sight. That scenario would represent true equality, and I am hopeful that one day we will see it, but not only in the US."
1689,"For Wambach to suggest that she is as valuable a presence as Kobe Bryant is ridiculous and vainglorious. In all sports and business the customer has the money. Revenues produced by the sport in question determine how much the players can be paid. Don't people know this? 

I love to watch women's tennis and think they should be paid almost as much as men. Not the same as they only play two out of three sets where men play  three out of five sets. Women's tennis also has some stars who have captured the world's attention such as the Williams sisters which generates more revenue for the sport. 

I love to watch the PGA but never watch the LPGA. I just don't find it interesting. The LPGA  only has a couple of stars who've captured world wide attention. As a result LPGA revenues are much less and thus the pay is less. 

In what sports should women make more than men? Women's gymnastics and women's figure skating come to mind."
1690,"I just wonder how many follow soccer here and of those who love the game, how many follow men world cup (biggest sport event on earth) vs. the woman?
Sporting events make money by sponsors (advertisers) and the rating (viewership) is what decides how much money is generated, which trickles down tot he players, men or women! Period!
Equal pay!
Why not pay everyone equally; employees in every company,  actors in every movie, singers of any songs, health providers and their administrators in every clinic...
The seekers of equality in print and media, are the nihilist of human diversities and differences.
My favorite soccer team is the US Woman team and I love every ball-pass and the last 13 goals they had on their first fiery match.
Go US Women... Go Champs!"
1691,"This is totally apples and oranges.  Men and women soccer players are in separate businesses, positions, and certainly do not compete with each other."
1692,"OK, let's settle this yearly. One Game . . . Men vs Women . . . Winner take All. Fair is Fair."
1693,"Men's soccer: HUGE global sport with billions and billions in revenue that includes big broadcasting contracts. You have to qualify to even participate in the World Cup by beating really good competition, and advancing in the World Cup is extremely difficult. Even modest success in the Cup earns teams a payment of millions of dollars. The best global players earn tens of millions playing for their league clubs. The US men only get paid by US Soccer for the games they play for the US team, and most players only play a portion of the US team's games. They all strive for spots on US pro league teams or teams overseas.
Women's soccer: Modestly popular in the US during the run up to the women's World Cup, but still a very minor draw here and a trivial sport in most other countries. Global revenues are miniscule compared to men's soccer and there is minimal opportunity to play the pro game for big dollars because the money and interest aren't there, here or overseas. The US women get a salary from US Soccer as well as game payments.
It's like comparing a single A baseball team to the Yankees or a minor sport like lacrosse to pro basketball. There is no comparison. I assume that everyone is aware that the greatest women's soccer players in the world can't compete with a good developmental team of teenage boys. This equality thing is nuts."
1694,"i'm really curious to see how the USWNT would do against any men's team.  there is probably an argument that is in the back of people's minds, ""well, it is a different level of play for men,  and I would love for the women's team to be able to shut that down."
1695,"I know nothing of the World Cup, but it is obvious that MLS teams can pay only what they collect from their customers -- and women's soccer teams average just 25% of what the men's teams do in attendance and even less in TV revenue. 
Comparing the two is comparing two completely different things and does not argue for ""equal pay,"" but just the opposite."
1696,"If you're titling the article ""Women's team"", you're contributing the disparity and keeping separate.  They are pretty much the best team in the world (with amount of goals) and should be treated the same as their colleagues."
1697,"The suggestion in the article that the teams can't even be compared because ""The women are way, way better"" is a red herring - I suppose meant to anger anyone that is rational.

Public funds could be split equally (or perhaps the women could even receive more or the public funds because of their success); non-designated sponsorships, donations and other non-traceable amounts divided equally; otherwise money should go to the team that generated the funds. It's not clear to me that the women aren't asking for a share the revenue generated by the men. Asking for ""equal pay"" straight up, seems to indicate the women don't really want their pay linked to ""revenue"". 

And feminists should perhaps stop about worrying the salary differences among female soccer players like Abby Wambach, Kobe Bryant, and Peyton Manning and more on the salary differences among almost everybody, Kobe Bryant, and Peyton Manning.  It's a legitimate political blind spot that people like Trump speak to."
1698,"many men argue that the women should be paid less because the fans spend more watching men's soccer.  that same logic means that they should agree that all consumer product companies should pay women more money than men because most consumer products are bought by women, NOT MEN."
1699,"To say that pay should be ""based only on the revenue they and their league generate"" is merely another fact of discrimination, albeit a different kind. 

TV Networks earn money off advertising. The ""big"" sports have tons of built-in advertising time. Heck, American football even has TV time-outs (as do other sports). This is not done in Soccer (Football). The average American football game takes has 20 minutes of action spread out over 4 hours of play. That equals LOTS of advertising. Overseas, Soccer (Football) advertising is generated from things other than 15-30 second video advertising. In the US, networks have decided to not bother. 

Since Networks can fill a sport with more video advertising time, they PROMOTE that sport far more than any other to boost their profit. It has nothing to do with how many fans there really are trying to watch the game. And it has nothing to do with how much revenue the Networks COULD get, if they just tried a little harder and actually PROMOTED the games equally. 

Maybe all soccer leagues should sue networks for discrimination in not equally promoting all sports... This would change the player compensation dramatically. 

Luckily the internet is changing everything. Therefore these women have every right to sue. And they should. The narrow-minded business model of the large Networks is antique. And there is no reason that one sport should be promoted more or less than any other."
1700,"Clearly, the women should be fighting for the right to play for the men's team.  With such great players added to the team, the men's team should easily win the next World Cup."
1701,"Silly.  What women soccer players get paid is, and must be, based only on the revenue they and their league generate, not on parity with men's salaries.  Nor will the league survive if there is a huge discrepancy between what soccer players in the US are paid, and what their counterparts in other countries are paid. Likewise, professional male lacrosse players are paid based on what their league can afford, not based on parity with professional baseball or football.  In the end, this is simply a sport activity that exists on the margin of popularity and profit, like track and field, lacrosse, archery, and tiddly winks."
1702,"The argument for equal pay is facile.  This is about fair pay not equal pay.  Lets compare apples to apples.  The mens national team is overpaid.  That's an objective statement based on attendance and team performance.  The women's team is underpaid based on the same criteria.  
US Soccer's focus is on suburban middle-class boys who feed the college system.  Women and minorities are an afterthought.  Women deserve a much bigger voice, fair pay for the national team and give them a chance to set the direction of the game in the US.  The men do not seem to be up to the task."
1703,Nice thoughts but it?s fan attendance that pays the salaries and the girls just don?t draw the crowds. Same in all sports. Equal pay for equal production and in sports it?s attendance.
1704,"Equal pay? That is ludicrous in the extreme. Perhaps, they should learn to play at least half as well as men do for starters, and then talk about equal pay. The quality of women's game is just dismal - that is why so few people want to watch it. I just watched a Women's World Cap game between two highly ranked teams and what a sorry spectacle that was ? slow and skill-less affair filled with errors ? and I am not planning to watch another one. That ""Best Women's Soccer Team in the World"" would be handily beaten by any recreational pub team made entirely of amateurs whose pay is exactly zero. Based on a fair comparison those women players are lucky to be paid at all. Where did they get the idea that they deserve the same pay as male stars who are watched by millions and generate billions dollars in revenue? And who could actually play. What arrogance."
1705,Wow.   Great reminder that a diverse group of woman have a place in the armed forces.
1706,"A great read, thanks. The US military has long been a vanguard for the ""better selves"" of our Nation, and this article highlights that, although unified, the armed services are ultimately a collection of individuals serving a common good. Obviously no one is perfect, but the sooner the services weed out the insecure outliers who bring misogyny the ranks, the better the fighting force will be overall, and in turn the country."
1707,Thank you to all the strong women writing in to share their valuable experiences! I have learned so much from you and respect deeply the work you've accomplished.
1708,I salute you all.
1709,"Proud of you, to achieve.
Hard work, determination, talent, self confidence.
As a woman in a male dominated field you have to work harder and be smarter, period."
1710,"One of the best articles the NYT has published. 
Makes me so proud to be a woman. More than I knew until I read this piece. Thank you, NYT. And thank you to every woman in this article, as well as to the thousands of others whose lived stories inspire us and make us all grow."
1711,"As a proudest supporter of my ?little? sister (actually in this article - Ashleigh Bryant Byrnes), I?d welcome her to have my six any day of the week. While I?m a better bullet catcher (biologically bigger and stronger) she is the feistiest spark plug that I know and I would not hesitate for a second to think that she would squeeze the trigger and put herself in danger to save my life. Eagle, Globe and Anchor siblings forever."
1712,"Why the TOP SECRET silence about LGBTQQ life in the modern military today? The Pentagon is totally mum on this important subject as well as publications such as VFW magazine. When asked about this gross omission, there is total, deafening silence! It?s been ten long years since President Obama made LGBTQQ?s whole in the military. A report card on this issue is long overdue, and the New York Times , at least, needs to address it....Please."
1713,I salute each of these women for their service.  US Army - Vietnam Veteran
1714,"I remember checking into my first Navy Squadron in the Philippines in 1991, the second of three women to be sent there.  My Division Officer called me into his office, where he was reading Playboy with his feet propped on the desk, and welcomed me aboard by bellowing ""Naval Aviation is a fraternity, and the sooner you girls accept that, the better off we'll be.""   So professional."
1715,Wow. I am in total awe of these women. I hope we don't have to wait until next year's International Women's Day to hear more of their stories.
1716,My sister tells the story of how she was hit on by her female company commander in Air force basic training (1952). The attempted seduction occurred when my sister went to the commander to complain about being hit on by another female trainee.
1717,"These stories are amazing, both the good and the bad.  It seems so much of a woman's destiny in the military is dependent on whether her male superiors respect women's humanity or dehumanize women as a class. The difference to these women was night and day. That's one of the reasons we need to put the spotlight on men. Discipline bullies, gaslighters and predators and hold male allies up as role models. All the talent, dedication and courage in the world can be thwarted by a woman's bad luck to be assigned to misogynist authority."
1718,"In 2017 Angel Richelle Dalton and Michelle Sims were stationed at Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point, NC when they wrote and performed in ?Warrior Women,? a dance theater piece, presented at Craven Community College, New Bern, NC. Scenes from it on youtube poignantly display their experiences as young women Marines and the range of their powerful feelings from humiliation to pride. The concluding scene, Till Valhalla,  <a href=""https://youtu.be/HLcTsGk6Ztw"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/HLcTsGk6Ztw</a> gives a sense of their struggle. Wendy Osserman conceived, choreographed and directed the evening length piece."
1719,"This article is powerful and yet disturbing.  Powerful in the many voices sharing their experiences overcoming obstacles, while serving proudly in service to our country.  Disturbing that after over almost 40 years since the first women to graduate from West Point, the armed forces are still rife with misogyny and coverups and protection for predators. For women and men to ""not trust the system"" such that they do not report, and for retaliation of reporting harassment or assault to exist, it requires tacit agreement of the male leadership.  Don't expect women to fix this, the responsibility for improvement lies squarely with the male leadership at every level. Men who disrespect women won't listen to a woman telling him to change his behavior. Male leaders need to step up."
1720,I feel overwhelmed by pride and more pride at the accomplishments of these people.  I couldn?t do what they do but I?m honored to support them and be on their team.  Thank you to all who serve and thank you for women who make me proud to be female.
1721,"I shouldn't be but I am still stunned at comments like ""it's (combat) too dangerous for a woman"".  I guess being parachuted into occupied France during WWII was a walk in the park for those brave women and men.

Russians had women in combat during that period as well as pilots, snipers and many other roles so why do these men feel so threatened in this day and age by a womanbeing able  doing his job or rather, being able to do the same job as he can.  Read an interesting article many years ago about women made excellent A-10 Warthog pilots becuase being shorter than males, they could pull and sustain more G in a turn.  Would that same butter bar wearing male who complained that ""women don't belong in combat"" refuse the support because a female A-10 pilot was saving his troops who were in close combat with the enemy."
1722,I look up to these Americans with great respect as they knock down barriers.  I am looking forward to the day where we don't see and define ourselves as men or women but people working together as a team getting a job done.
1723,"Fantastic article. So hard to believe that U.S. military has so much trouble dealing with progress. Females, LGBTQ, and the few males that are willing to promote progress are the real; heroes in the armed forces. It is so very sad that trump and the military leaders that surround him are so opposed to moving forward. Unfortunately, MAGA does not include recognizing women as leaders and real people. Same holds true for those who describe as LGBTQ. Hopefully, in 2020 and beyond, America can join the 21st century and say good bye to hate and discrimination."
1724,"I hope that present and future generations of men see women as their equal.   Thank you to all these hardworking,  persistent,  strong women and your service.  You're magnificent!   Bravo!"
1725,"These vignettes are so interesting (in every sense of that word), but I kept wishing I could know more and have more context.  If any of the women are ok with it, is there a chance for longer articles?  Or memoirs, where appropriate?"
1726,"I was is the Air Force both active duty and full time reserves for 24 years. I worked as an aircraft mechanic for all of that time and I'm female. About ten years after I retired from the military I was working for DOD. Across the cubicle hall sat my one of my former squadron commanders (a former fighter pilot). He told me one day that he nor any of his fellow fighter pilots ever had an issue with flying the aircraft that I had worked on. I was speechless and just stood there looking at him. After he never got the thanks back that he expected he said something like you don't really care do you.  I responded back, yes I don't really care. 
As a taxpayer I had a right to that job and I was very very good at it.  My advice to other women who want to join the military is just do it. Do your fair share or more of the work when you have the time and do it correctly.  Military jobs can often transition into good paying civilian jobs. Technical competence is key. Once you get that you won't have much trouble. You may still feel scared and frustrated sometimes, but at least you won't have to worry about money and you can be independent."
1727,"As a young woman who has contemplated joining the military numerous times, these stories are both intensely inspiring and intimidating. The strength and resilience of these women in the face of such adversity is nothing short of amazing, but the thought of fighting through the institutionalized misogyny they mentioned sounds exhausting. We've come so far in such a short time with allowing women to join all branches of the military, allowing them into active combat rolls, and the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", but perhaps I'm being cynical when I say it still seems like full equality is a long fight away. The lack of respect and support for military women seems an insurmountable barrier now, but it doesn't have to be for future generations. The best offense is to drag it into the open for discussion, so thanks NYT for such a great article. Happy International Women's day!"
1728,"I wish the women had been asked how they feel about tech employees wanting their companies not to work for the military.

This very memorable set of recollections is demeaned and diminished by having the second story be about recognizing Wiccans.  amid stories of courageous women who were in combat, injured, watched friends die, were abused, etc, Wiccan issues made the top 40?"
1729,I met my wife in the Army Reserves...we have been married for 33 years as of today!  We were both enlisted at the time but she convinced me to go to Officer Candidate School and earn a commission.  It changed the trajectory of my life...I am retired and currently working as a Department of the Army civilian...thanks for this article NYT!
1730,"Enlightening piece about the panoply of gender identification.

Back in the 1980s, as an inspection engineer, I learned to defy Strunk & White and use non-specific plural pronouns to avoid identifying specific personnel who may have performed well or transgressed.  

My bosses were not pleased, but I convinced them that using plural pronouns such as they, them and their avoided identifying those (like Cheryl) who were gender outliers in their chosen profession.

To this day, I continue in the spirit of using this blanket approach to not identifying people by their gender.  But rather, treat them as beings."
1731,Live and let live.  This country should always be open to those we don't understand or even see as 'weird' - as long as they don't harm or degenerate others.
1732,"?After Stonewall,? Levy said, ?there were enough people who finally said, ?I?m not going to lie anymore. I?m not going to deny who I am. I want to be happy and live my life without stigma, without feeling inferior.??

1733,"How many here predicting a censorship apocalypse if Taplin's ideas are implemented, realize that they are posting on a *moderated* comments thread?"
1734,"AAaaah! The irony of it. I remember when the country was having a nearly identical argument over Pornography. And the positions were reversed. With the right arguing for standards and rules and left screaming censorship. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Does it pinch? 

You can't have it both ways folks! You can either have Censorship or you can have freedom of speech. 

A couple of notes I will throw in for the Irony of it:
1) Would this censorship apply to say Louis Farrakhan or does it only apply to some groups?

2) 8Chan is incorporated in the Philippines US law is ...irrelevant there!"
1735,"Huh? No. The problem with speech online is the anonymity. Rather than control speech, make it public. Ask 8chan and Reddit and YouTube and even the comments section of the New York Times to stop allowing anonymous accounts, and reveal who says what vile thing."
1736,"Wow, read through the replies here and the number of people advocating wholesale suppression of speech through exposure to litigation or legislation is insane. And people think Trump is an existential threat to our democracy? There's no conceivable firebreak here, one's person's pornography is another person's hate speech. This is a very slippery slope indeed."
1737,"I would be very surprised if anyone could force 8chan to do anything at this point. The site never truly went down, only the easy to access front end. 8chan itself real time propagates itself to a peer network which basically means so long as even a handful of users have the site it will end up being constantly re-established"
1738,"Ultimately, the problem with desperate and uneducated people sharing their toxic thoughts online, is not their ability to share thoughts online. 

The problem lies with desperation and lack of education."
1739,"I found this descriptive very helpful. It's a deep dive into the amoral computer experts of the internet: ""The site?s now characteristic tone of performative erudition?hyperrational, dispassionate, contrarian, authoritative?often masks a deeper recklessness. Ill-advised citations proliferate; thought experiments abound; humane arguments are dismissed as emotional or irrational. Logic, applied narrowly, is used to justify broad moral positions. The most admired arguments are made with data, but the origins, veracity, and malleability of those data tend to be ancillary concerns."" <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news"" target=""_blank"">https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news</a>

Lotta jawbreaking words in there, but the point is that supposedly moral arguments are being made without regard to the victims of this supposed ""freedom"" of speech.

I often wonder what ""freedoms"" victims have, when allies of hostile provocation argue for their supposedly ""constitutional"" right to maim, kill, and discredit ordinary people who are just trying to get through the day."
1740,"Sincerely asking, not a lawyer. What do legal minds say about imposing provenance laws. I mean how can a platform legally make it so our civil liberties are protected while things do not magically appear on a platform like FB without it being clear to all the users who first posted it? My sense of the complications goes first to how anonymity is useful in social uprisings such as in the Arab spring. The authorities if I remember correctly, just unplugged the services. But what are the other problems and what are solutions toward having it so basically, if you post it first, it can be known that you posted it first. Because my impression is this is not what we have now. Thank you."
1741,"The way to solve this problem is not to hold Social Media Companies liable for what people post, but rather require Social Media Companies to know who posted the offensive message. That is, pass a law stating that Social Media cannot allow anyone to post on their sites with out knowing for sure the identity of that person. Why should this great country be destroyed so that Facebook can remain one of the most profitable companies in the world?"
1742,"Sounds great but it?s absolutely impossible to do.  Whether you?re talking about Facebook, Reddit or any of these other groups, there are thousands of people posting, constantly.  It would be absolutely impossible financially to have the kind of staff necessary to be blocking, in real-time, those who are posting incendiary messages even assuming you could train people to do so to the degree necessary to avoid liability."
1743,"The idea that Facebook and Google can easily and transparently automatically computer-censor ""bad"" content without censoring ""good"" content is chimerical and risible.

The first government regulation of radio, then television content, led from the early days of freedom and innovation pretty quickly to an duopoly of two corporations: RCA and CBS.

You might want to take a look at and consider, Frank Waldrop and Joseph Borkin's 1938 book, ""Television, a Struggle for Power.""

The power to control and censor internet content is the power to control the agenda of and framing of issues in society. No single government nor corporation should have such power. That's the issue here."
1744,"A couple of years ago, the US identified a number of Facebook accounts that were actually fronts for the Russian government, spreading disinformation. Slowly and begrudgingly, FB shut down those accounts, and then held it up as evidence of their good corporate citizenship. 

But they could have done so much more. With all their wealth and technology, they could easily have determined which users received the fake posts, and notified them. Anyone who reposted that info should have been made aware that they had unwittingly spread Russian propaganda, a valuable teaching opportunity. At every turn, the tech giants come up a day late and a (billion) dollar short.

Concerns about censorship are valid, but so are concerns that we're allowing a handful of companies and individuals to control a huge segment of our commerce and communications. History has shown that concentrated power leads to bad outcomes."
1745,"Based on very real events going on right now:

A mentally disturbed person has a long enemies list. To revenge himself he posts complete fabrications against not only those people, but their relatives he has never met, accusing them of lurid crimes. These results show up when the targeted people are googled.

A court has determined the material to be defamatory & ordered it taken down. But the author has gone underground -- taking his computer with him, of course.

The legal precedent is from the California Supreme Court, in a recent case involving Yelp. Yelp fought for & won the right, under Section 230, to keep up the material which the court had ruled defamatory. So if you can't find & compel the original poster to take it down, you may be completely out of luck.

It's the tech companies which make this material available for the world to see. How is it a just and reasonable result that they can't be required to take down defamatory material? Why should Congress give these companies an immunity from compliance with court orders that no one else has?"
1746,"As of this writing, there are 285 comments on this article, all of which fall within Section 230.  If the author's suggestion is implemented, the NYT would be liable for the content of any of these comments - which means its staff would have to spend all day reviewing comments and couldn't do their jobs.  The only way to avoid liability would be to shut down the comment section.  The internet lives and breathes through Section 230, in ways the author does not understand."
1747,"This article has surely opened up a hornet's nest of comments about ""freedom of speech"". But what about the freedoms of the victims of hate? I remember in Boston right after Charlottesville, ""freedom of speech"" was the cry of the demonstrators, who required police protection. 40,000 people showed up to protest them - all 40 of them. They've done better since then, but the waste of humanity and goodwill is staggering.

It reminds me of those who promote universal easy access to machines for killing a lot of people in a hurry. Whatever motivates these skilled computer users to enable the lowest forms of communication, I wish they would put their skills to better use. They have all their arguments pat, but like with guns, I prefer working with other people for good and to solve problems, not going to extremes to protect those whose destructive influence is dissolving the civil society and the country I know and love.

They also appear to be making claims of patriotism and calling those who condemn violence un-American. Really?

It's time for people of goodwill to come together to solve problems such as climate change, criminalization of poverty,  concentration of wealth at the top by replacing jobs with benefits with ""gigs"". And, in a class by itself, the theft of elections and the rule of the majority by a minority who don't have any conscience about accepting help from some extremely dubious allies (Putin, MBS, and Kim Jong Un come to mind). How much ""freedom"" is that?"
1748,"Yes.  Great idea.  Change that law and sue the heck out of them all for allowing such hatred to permeate our society and, ultimately, causing the death and injury of so many.  Sue them all out of existence."
1749,"We live in a world where the president conflates resisting racism with racism.  It's a common practice to claim that pointing out abuse by the police or other state-actors is ""hate speech.""  In that world, I'd prefer to keep 230 in place and continue to use social pressure and decency as the primary tool for upholding community standards for speech.

I understand that's not sufficient in the face of sites like 8chan and in the wake of the recent acts of domestic terrorism.

But that's why I differ from the author.  The problem isn't that ""people are saying bad things on line."" The problem is that people are becoming terrorists on line.

We don't have to argue about what can or cannot be said.  We don't need to get into debates about what constitutes a ""thought crime.""

We have juries, judges, warrants and intelligence agencies, we just need to put them to good use when it comes to identifying domestic terrorist organizations and recognizing the difference between trying to give people a chance to talk vs. aiding and abetting.  One of those activities should be broadly protected and held dear.  The other should be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible without becoming cruel or unusual."
1750,"Thr president doesn't care, and will gladly forward any racist or hateful tweet that comes across his screen, if it serves his political and personal agenda."
1751,"I read this article hoping for a thoughtful discussion of new approaches to address this issue.  I did not get that.
What part of ?free speech? does the author not understand?"
1752,"If your goal is to completely remove freedom of speech online, this will help achieve that. The only reason these platforms exist is because they were protected from constant frivolous litigation from upset users.

I think the author and those supporting him would be more comfortable in China, where everything you post online is monitored by the State and having the wrong opinions is punishable in a social credit system that forces you gradually out of society. 

If you think it will not happen, just look at the ""do not fly"" lists created in the wake of 9/11. How simple it is to arbitrarily restrict the freedoms of people who have committed no crimes in the name of national security. How simple it is to expand the definition of a dangerous or suspicious individual who has to be monitored and forbidden from using certain forms of transport. So you say you're only going to censor and deplatform the terrorists and white supremacists? How long until anybody that criticizes the government is deemed a potential terrorist? How long until merely exercising your first amendment right to protest puts you on a list that gets you shadowbanned on the internet?

Anyone supporting this is disgusting and unamerican."
1753,"Make them pay damages, and jail the owners.  That should take care of it."
1754,"Yes, I agree completely. When someone says something you don't like, silence them by removing their ability to communicate. Better, why not issue imprimaturs so we know only approved messages are allowed to circulate? Only nice, safe and bland communications reflecting the popular thoughts of the day should be permitted.  

Signed, 
     You friendly neighborhood fascist. 

Seriously, did no one read Fahrenheit 451? The notion of using offence as the social imperative behind mass censorship is an old idea. And it is just as bad now as ever!

And precisely what is the philosophical underpinning behind assuming ""we can all agree"" specified content should not be allowed on major nodes of communication? No, we don't all agree. Nor can we agree even objectively horrible content creates a social emergency requiring censorship. Beware of moral panics!"
1755,"Verizon owns yahoo. Business divisions should not shield the provider in this case.

Additionally, the public has the same inherent right to establish terms of service and guidelines for these businesses to operate under. Congress needs to assert that right and will of the people."
1756,"There's a massive difference between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ABC, and social media platforms. By definition TV channels choose what they broadcast - they create the content. Conversely, social media platforms rarely actually create any of the content that you see on them - they merely function as intermediaries for different members to post. As a result, this analogy is completely incorrect: in one case you punish an entity for content they created, in the other you punish the entity for content they have never even condoned.

This is an extreme example, but if I write hate speech inciting violence with pencil and paper, is it the fault of the pencil manufacturer?"
1757,"Correct me if wrong. Right now the major players are private spaces. They may function as public accommodation, however, I am not sure.  As private spaces the major players already have the power to remove content posted by users. Of course, users have no ""right"" to speak in any private space -- they have a tentative invitation which may be revoked at any time. (E.g. The Times may choose not to publish this note, and after a succession of unacceptable notes, they may prevent my further access altogether). Users may claim the shield of journalism, and scream foul for ""free speech"" however, but without government intervention, the private space is within its right to remove them.  We should be wary of declaring the major players to be publishers, for if so, they would suddenly inherit rights which they currently may not have, those derived from the first amendment.  As to the issue of liability, Times v. Sullivan is a good place to start if Facebook is suddenly declared a publisher."
1758,"You want Congress to write a national ""privacy policy""? I can see it now. Corporations, henceforth, may only use your data ""as permitted by law."""
1759,"Here is a simple solution to much of this: for an EULA or privacy policy to be enforceable, the company must be able to demonstrate that the user 1) had REALLY read the policy, 2) UNDERSTOOD the policy, and 3) AGREED to the policy.  This is the standard used for informed consent in research and healthcare.  

This would mean things like presenting the policy one screen at a time forcing each page to display long enough for average reading speed.  It also implies that the user must pass a quiz on the material.  Any question the get wrong means that provision is not enforceable. 

This, of course, would destroy e-commerce if companies stick with their current policies.  It would force them to come up with simple and uniform wording and policies."
1760,"Any effective US privacy law must also include meaningful protections for privacy professionals.  It is not uncommon for some organizations to marginalize or drive out their privacy professionals in response to the legal advice that they provide.  Unfortunately, regulators do not have the skills nor the resources to address this type of compliance challenge.  Additionally, enforcement mechanisms are not robust enough to force compliance.  As with other compliance regimes, transparency will increase compliance.  We need to democratize enforcement through transparency (like breach notification) and create an enforcement mechanism in the private marketplace. Rewarding a whistleblower an award should s/he prove retaliation is one way to protect privacy professionals. If privacy professionals are not protected, then data is not protected."
1761,"Oh, for heaven?s sake!  The laws of the nation must place man above machine.  All tracking, correlating, collecting of data about citizens must stop.  Advertising and marketing that is personalized in any way and especially via collected data is amoral per se."
1762,Protecting our privacy from a company that just wants to profit off it is necessary. One enormous fine should be to share those profits with the owners of the information they sell.
1763,America needs thoughtful legislation and regulation like a fish needs water but that won't be happening until some time in an imagined future where legislators aren't politicians.
1764,"The author is conflating at least two different issues in this article, which should be regulated differently.  One component is the aggregation of de-identified information (eg looking at the frequency of search terms by location) and the other is aggregation of personally identifiable information (eg targeted ads).  I suspect that there is a lot that can be done with the former eg AI algorithms for cancer detection, risk for diabetes, traffic, etc., whereas for the latter, not so much.  The only reason that a company needs personally identifiable information is to sell you stuff.  I?m pretty sure that most people would be happy to provide their data if it was completely and reliably de-identified.  Facebook and many other companies have made a fortune selling other peoples data; the healthcare industry has figured out how to do this without the need for anyone?s name, email address, or social security number because they are focusing on patient outcomes rather than ad dollars..."
1765,"We don?t need a thing. I?ve used google and all their various search, email, mapping and other free services for twenty years now and have never read their privacy policy or cared about it. 

They provide free (to me) and valuable services. If you don?t like them, don?t use them. 

The only thing privacy laws will do is strengthen the power of Google Facebook Amazon and others like GDPR has done because only they have the resources to comply."
1766,"During the 1980s, cocaine sales was growing faster than the stock market. So based on that, by your logic, cocaine should be legal?

Whether an industry grows or not should not be the primary basis for such a critical national policy."
1767,"This op-ed is very obviously written by a corporate shill. Stifling innovation? Please- selling doctors prescribing practices so drug companies can target the pushers is not ""innovation."" And yet the supreme Court held in IMS v sorrell that the first amendment somehow protects that ""speech"" (except of course, it's not speech as speech conveys a message; raw data isn't speech). 

The real issue with meaningful data legislation is the same issue in all of American politics - all three branches of government are completely in the pocket of corporate America, and meaningful data privacy regulation would cut off the biggest emerging market they have. This op-ed is yet another example of their massive influence."
1768,"Good article on an important topic. Privacy protection for personal data must become the default.  People who wish to opt out should be able to by taking explicit actions to do so. 

Tech management will always try to claim that it is a choice between privacy and innovation and/or consumer features.  But we are not stupid, we know what it's really about for them: profits.

Unfortunately, I don't see any meaningful privacy protection legislation enacted while the GOP is in control of either chamber of congress or the WH.  After all, their true constituency is the rich and powerful.  Data leeches included."
1769,"Mr.  Lefkowitz does a fair job of presenting the corporate-centric view of privacy.

As for users, not so much. Indeed, not much of anything. Be ""thoughtful"" he says. I can see it now in the updated privacy statement:

""The corporation is always very thoughtful about your privacy.""  (...every time we are taking all your data.)



Frankly, that doesn't seem very....helpful."
1770,"Good luck! Now that the a average driver thinks signaling turns is an invasion of privacy,
common sense is out the window in this post truth world that?s knocking on our door.  
Signal your intentions, but don?t answer the door."
1771,Perhaps what is needed is a clear acknowledgment that any data generated by or about a person is the absolute property of that person - like a copyright. Those profiting from the use of our data must then share the profits with us.
1772,"The notion of consumer privacy ?agreements? that users click on to accept is fundamentally flawed. Users are in no position to understand the terms of those agreements, and are therefore not competent to decide.
Instead, all such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the Consumer Protection Board, based on criteria established by law, through a transparent process.
Now that would privacy legislation that we can believe in."
1773,"?....Finally, the law must not be so burdensome that it cuts off innovation and economic opportunity.?

Innovation in what?ripping me off?  Controlling what information I see?  Data is unfathomable, unprecedented power; gathering it is itself an abuse, whether by a research hospital or by Facebook.

We should demand technology that?s designed for us to use, not technology that?s designed to use us."

1776,Okay - cool. But would you defend a device that enhanced the male sexual experience? I?m think no - it would be considered to be gross and an example of negative male sexual energy. I?ve loved this newspaper for the past 50 years - but I?m starting to get a bit sick of the anti- straight male bias that is coupled with an ?anything goes? female or gay point of view.

1784,"Well, the last sentence is the clincher: ""...(rented) an entire room to show VR porn"".

American men have become such sexual hysterics.
Pence won't dine with a woman.
Republicans are determined to strip women, not only of abortion rights but also access to birth control.
Migrant women, held prisoner, are unable to get an abortion without major legal fights.
Incels are demanding their very own sex slaves.

When did American men become so creepy?
I'm 70 so this isn't new - but that makes the question: Why are men in this country STILL so ignorant and bizarre?

Look, ""corporate America"": Get your weird nose out of women's ladyparts and just concentrate on equal pay. It's 2019 and we are all aware that if you want to make unbelievable profits, then all you have to do is rip off every woman working for you by about 20%. That's the only ""freebie"" that you get.

Now, go watch your porn and leave creating a new world to us.
I have NO DOUBT that we will do a far better job."

1787,CES got it wrong and should fix their process  -- if they are serious about diversity.  Either get rid of virtual reality porn or reinstate the award for this product. They should also come clear on what actually caused them to rescind the award. All the reasons listed sound pretty lame.
1788,Gratuitously boneheaded action by CES that got it wrong so many ways.  They possibly were trying to prevent a backlash from the big tech companies who have enough problems now with their industrialized invasion of privacy.  And recall that Apple recently caused Tumblr to ban all NSFW content and thereby alienate a large part of that platform's most dedicated users. Sex confuses Silicon Valley.

1793,"So mankind makes the vast majority of pornography that is misogynistic yet when a hands-free (no man required) female sex toy is produced, the patriarchal world loses its mind?

Wake up boys, women are your equals whether you agree to not.  Why shouldn't women be able to enjoy fun sex toys?

1799,The majority of domestic workers aren't employed by one single employee. Any new legislation should also try to address the plight of a house cleaner or gardener who is juggling multiple clients. Create a program that allows multiple employers to fund a single employee's sick leave or health insurance. Just because the employee isn't relying on a single income stream doesn't make their position any more secure.
1800,"Of course domestic workers deserve rights, contracts and labor protections.  But let's get real - it's not going to happen while illegal alien labor makes up the backbone of the domestic labor force.  Workers in the country illegally typically don't know and / or do not report labor violations for the obvious reasons (language barriers, fear of removal) and this would not change with additional legislation.  And as long as there is a core domestic workforce that is outside of the laws working in the shadow economy, they will set the floor and the norm for pay and conditions."
1801,"Does anyone seriously think that if you make nannies labor more expensive it won't just be taken out directly from the bottom line. Where i live a good nanny commands a $25 an hour wage, pretty on par with other jobs in the area. That is typically paid under the table. If you start adding on FICO taxes, insurance costs, paid leave, it will all just come out of the wages or the nanny would lose her job. 

It's not like nannies are being employed by huge corporations. They are employed by households with two working parents. Those are not the 0.1%. Also many nannies are in the US illegally.  Try to bring them onto the books and their job is gone. 

If you think you are doing nannies a favor with this poiicy, you're not. You're just destroying the only jobs standing between them and poverty."
1802,"Great idea! This bill will help end the classism we so blithely ignore. All workers deserve the same rights and privileges as their employers. Cleaning a toilet or a baby's bottom is as worthy a job as any.  I once lived in a country where folks respect the men and women who clean homes and care for children. By law, when I moved away, I was obligated to pay my cleaner and nanny compensation equal to about 3 months of their pay. Paid vacations, absolutely. They were paid when I traveled and did not need their services. Why should the folks who committed their working hours to me be punished if I decided to spend a month abroad? All sick days paid, too. Then again, we enjoyed universal health care, a guarantee of never being thrown into the street and every citizen has a pension. 
Get down on your knees and start doing the scrubbing, hauling, hand-holding and shlepping then tell me whether or not your labors have value. I'm betting you'll join the chorus for equality and respect for all. Don't want to pay? Do the work yourself."
1803,"There are a surprising number of cheap Americans among those that hire nannies and other housekeeping help, and I say this as an American. Years ago in my capacity as a community volunteer I facilitated a child care arrangement for an older female client trying to make her way back into the work force. She had years of experience raising children and loved them; the perfect person for part time child care work. Unfortunately despite my best efforts, I found that the mothers wanted her to watch kids (always more than one and usually included an infant), shop and do housework for $10 an hour. I advised her to decline these offers. Another common request was that they be on call! Other similar experiences were disheartening - people are willing to pay more for pet sitters than a qualified loving person to watch their kids. Why do people think nannies and housekeepers should work for dirt wages?"
1804,"This is important. Nannies and other domestic workers deserve clearly outlined contracts, salaries/wages and responsibilities. Moreover, the AuPair programs in the US need to be revamped and included in these proposals. These women are being paid <$200 per week to care for up to 4 children for 45hrs/week, including early mornings, overnights, holidays and weekends. They are supposedly in a ""cultural exchange"" program but are often treated horribly,  and not supported in taking classes (the purpose of their stay) because they interfere with childcare. Many high-income professional families utilize them for their flexibility, but they offer far less than minimum wage for 24/7 coverage."
1805,"I don't think anyone should be outside the system of federal labor protections. The author mentions that farm workers, as well as domestic workers, were excluded from the New Deal labor protection acts. Have they been covered by subsequent legislation?

Many state employees were ""opted-out"" of Security Security and Medicare by states that now claim they can't pay for the pensions and medical care they promised. Those workers should be brought in to the federal systems. 

And, to avoid, employers cheating employing of benefits and other protects by paying them ""off the books,"" we should go to a system of payments made only electronically to accounts associated with social security numbers or the equivalent. Eliminate paper money and provide coins worth no more than $10?at most?for petty transactions. (That last suggestion will require that we solve the problem of undocumented workers. Do that whatever way you want, but do it. Having a pool of workers who cannot call in the government when they are cheated makes it easier for employers to cheat all employees.)"
1806,"These workers are part of our shadow economy due, in large part, to the lack of reliable, universal child-care programs that many countries in Europe and elsewhere enjoy.

For the families that really want and can afford ""in-house"" child-care, let them pay the full price of hiring these people, including their benefits and protections.

For the majority of Americans, let's work on providing high-quality, universal pre-K (and even universal nurseries) so that parents can earn for their families without having to worry about the care of their youngsters as well."
1807,"There was not a mention of paying social security contributions here. I always paid 100 % of the required contribution because it was so hard for the employee to come up with their expected 50%. I felt it was something that I could and should do. The talks were often difficult. Several became hysterical at the prospect."" No one else keeps these records. I'm not sure this is good for me. Now I'll have to pay taxes."" I had to insist with some of them: ""I'm going to stay transparent with the government rules. And you will be grateful in your old age that you are in the system"". Many of these women had no idea of what they were foregoing by being under the table. An organization that looks out for and advocates for them is overdue. But I agree with others that a 30 days notice with paid severance very much depends upon performance. There are those who would ride that particular horse into lengthy periods of regular time off. There are many others  who actually deserve a pension-which they very seldom get. Retirement benefits are a difficult issue for these workers but should start with being in the Social Security system as a minimum."
1808,"This why the liberal Democrats of the NY metro region support and encourage undocumented immigrants. They work cheap. And so those wealthy Americans, earning $100,000 and up, don't have to pay the wages legal residents demand to clean their homes, take care of their children, cook their restaurant meals, etc, etc. Ask anyone over 65 who did these jobs decades ago and who does them now. We know poor Americans couldn't compete with the wages the undocumented work for."
1809,In the USA a common thought is you get what you pay for. What does it say that well-off Americans will not pay well for the care given to their own children? What does it say that they abuse those who care for their own children?
1810,"Most of this is great and long overdue.  I wonder about the part about ""fair notice"" of hours changes, though.  If you're caring for children, they're inherently somewhat unpredictable.  A six-year-old isn't going to ask if it's fair notice before they get sick and have to stay home from school.  For that matter, when the parents are employees with potentially unpredictable schedules themselves, giving notice in advance of schedule changes may not be possible."
1811,I am all for protections for workers. No one should be exploited.
1812,"I can hear the right wing now, same song and dance as any other time society tries to improve conditions for anyone:

That will make it expensive so they won?t get hired at all so the socialist left is actually hurting them, you?re supposed to start out suffering in poverty in a low paying undignified job so you will have incentive to better yourself, and besides it?s better than it was where you came from or you wouldn?t be here, if you don?t like it go back."
1813,Maybe NYT OpEd could provide some templates from other developed European or Asian countries regarding their enacted labor laws for unskilled illiterate labor paid on the black market?
1814,"Most domestic workers are not ""white"". What chance does this bill have with our current senate and president ?"
1815,"First, the law is simply a vehicle for Kamala Harris to show her left wing bona fides when there is no chance that it will be passed.  More importantly, the article fails to determine the impact on total jobs that a law like this would have.   How many women and men will forced out of the workforce as childcare or home care costs increase forcing a spouse to stay home?  

I'm surprised that the Nytimes has not come forth with a ""reporters living wage bill"".  What ratio should the reports make in comparison to CEO Mark Thompson who made ~$6M last year?  I'd like to know the ratio of women, men, gays, bi, etc,  blacks, latinos, asians, christians, jewish, muslims, atheists, Democrats, Republicans, Indpendents,  reporters there are what is the target for each group."
1816,"There is a difference between employing a person to work on a factory floor or a minimum wage job like a shipping clerk at Amazon.com and employing someone, a stranger, to work in your home where you and your family are most vulnerable.  In my greater community, in my state, domestic workers are not primarily foreign born immigrants, legal or otherwise.  It's a job for people who often can't get a job anywhere else and there is generally a reason for it.  They are mostly black and white Americans, in equal numbers, perhaps a few from other ethnic backgrounds.  A few are quite professional and conscientious but many, the majority that worked for me, are opportunistic thieves struggling to make a living, and some are mentally unstable and potentially dangerous if provoked, hence their inability to get a decent job elsewhere.  This sounds quite disparaging to the goals and objectives of the author of this article but that has been my personal experience in the eight years that I employed domestic workers in my home to care for my aged mother.  I would have been glad to hire a foreigner because they are generally more trustworthy, honest and hard working.  Maybe.  
These people are in your home, often when you are away and not supervising.  Your family members are extremely vulnerable.  If you thought it necessary to fire someone it would be risky, dangerous, foolish to give an unstable personality advance notice of your intentions.  It's not an ordinary job."
1817,"For the six years that we had a live-in nanny, everything was ""on the books"", plus we paid health insurance, contributed to an IRA, and provided PTO. Hours were strictly regulated.

It was expensive and cumbersome, but you get what you pay for. And as liberal Democrats, anything less would have been hypocritical."
1818,"In NYC, it's appalling how many nannies are paid ""off-the-books"" compared to other cities.

It's often used as a justification to pay the nanny more, but more often than not, it's just an excuse for parents not to pay the taxes themselves.

By being paid OTB, nannies are often trapped in their work arrangement - they usually have no contract, no insurance and no unemployment benefits.

It boggles my mind how many extremely wealthy (and ostensibly pro-labor) New Yorkers don't think twice about the exploitation of labor in their own homes."
1819,"Whenever the government quotes the 'jobs' number, I wonder what the federal definition of a job is.

Does a federal 'job' support a family of four? Wages and benefits. Does it even support a single person?"
1820,"I have found that the way people think about, refer to and treat ?nannies,? house cleaners and similar homecare workers is a good measure of their character. I can?t begin to count how many supposedly liberal, politically woke people I have known (including relatives), or just met briefly, who think it?s fine to underpay and overwork these employees. Even crow about it. The most offensive to me is when a wealthy parent (any parent, really, but it is most galling among the affluent) hires the cheapest available caretaker for a child, pays her nearly nothing, and expects that ?nanny? to also clean the house and do the laundry. It?s shockingly common."
1821,"This bill is unlikely to actually improve the lives of nannies, house cleaners, etc. The vast majority either work for an agency or are paid under the table. Domestic workers at companies, for example MollyMaid, have working conditions similar to other low-wage occupations: the wages are low, but the hours, pay, etc are already formalized. Domestic workers being paid under the table are already breaking the law, so I fail to see how this would change that.

I do genuinely feel bad for domestic workers who are exploited by their employers, but it's really hard to fix that while so many of them are being paid under the table.

I also don't want to just blame the domestic workers. It's hard for people with no skills, especially recent immigrants with limited education and English skills, to find jobs in America. That's also hard to fix."
1822,"Does this agreement apply only if the employer is paying taxes on his/her domestic worker?

How does this work if the employer is not paying taxes?

Kelly"
1823,"Maybe this will increase sympathy for employers.  Everything about having employees is a hassle, and everyone thinks that employees are being exploited at every turn.  You don't get any thanks for employing someone."
1824,"What this article conveniently forgets to mention is that most times the people doing the tasks are in poor 3rd world countries in Africa and Asia. And over there, where average monthly pay is <$100 earning even $1 and hour is a huge improvement in quality of life. And many tasks pay way more than that."
1825,"When greed capitalism is staring you in the face, what is there to say?  Amazon and the rest of these tech companies are what is wrong with this country.  People hate on Bernie, Warren but here is a clear example of how you can work yourself to death, no benefits and your purpose in life is to work for the plantation owner and then do everyone a favor by disappearing.  Out of sight and out of mind is the American way, 
Some of us know who we are voting for and I am delighted that this madness of greed was uncovered by the NYT.  

We are not waiting any longer for a chance in this country, we are voting for people who actually know what is going on in this country and are dedicating their lives to help us change the status quo.

I was at a meeting yesterday  where I was informed that hook worm is a part of life in rural sections of Alabama.  Depressing to listen to these third world stories in Alabama.

  It is not just enough to get a democratic in office they need to do be held accountable help everyone in there state especially Alabama.  What has the democrat been doing all this time?  No one should be left behind Amazon  a wonderful example  a company  rolling in money  pays people 97Cents. Jeff Bezos is no better than the man in the white house.  cheap and pathetic.  Who cares about his acholic father, now hurting the American people, 

Greed, hatred for America that made him rich.   Thank god Amazon did not come to Queens."
1826,"I remember living in London in the early nineties. Princess Diana and her friends were Sloan Rangers, and Mia Farrow's skewered Valentine to Woody Allen was on the cover of the British newspapers. Peter Greenaway's Baby of Macon was playing at the Lumiere, and the escalators in Harrod's were adorned with massive, ceiling to floor banners of photos of Madonna. I'm 57 y/o and I still remember how I felt riding down those escalators - as though I was slowly sliding down the face of a Goddess."
1827,"What. Is. This?  The writer did her best, but seems like a Vanity Fair style deal was cut guaranteeing Madge a cover to promote her new album. But it would be nice if she gave an actual interview, instead of various platitudes, wrapped in enigmas and attitude dancing. JR's work was great, but...sorry, no go. Album sounds like it will be a bust, too."
1828,"From very first paragraph with the ""younger"" madonnas, to the second paragraph that has the choreographer noting how ?It?s so nice to see her smile,? to the third which compares her moves to Taylor Swift's backflips, then the 4th about older musicians having to pander...this entire article is filled with ageist nastiness. It appears almost every paragraph has a dig at her. Not only does Madonna deserve much better, nobody deserves to be viewed through this nasty lense."
1829,"I love this piece almost as much as I (we, & wife) loved this lady. Rock on sugar, your way."
1830,"Without Pattie Smith and Debbie Harry, there would not have been a Madonna."
1831,I'd love to see a photo of what she REALLY looks like. I guess she would never allow it!
1832,"Wow. What kind of grown man with a successful career takes $75 million from a woman? I have zero respect for Guy Ritchie. I certainly won't be contributing to his coffers in the future. Wow. Just. Wow. I can see why Madonna doesn't want her son to be with that kind of ""man"" full time. Nice article."
1833,The author injected too many of her own thoughts and impressions and should have allowed the reader to interpret the ?interview? and the subject?s words without her subjective perspective.  I found the author?s interference distracting and annoying.
1834,"There were hundreds of aspiring Madonnas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The one from Michigan made it. Selling pop music to little kids. Desperate. Shameless. Ruthless. Making money, which is all that she?s about, and the only thing that she?s about. This article is just so much glib cultural puffery about mass entertainment. Sad and shallow story about a shallow and graceless ?artist?."
1835,"As a gay man who came of age & out in the 80?s & 90?s, she is an icon and a touchstone to my youth.
As a person who lost an eye in a horrible childhood accident and has had to work through patches & prosthetics for 50 years, I find her adopting an eye patch as a fashion accessory pathetic and insulting."
1836,"I've often wished Madge would devote her position to searching out, nurturing, and producing new talent."
1837,Madonna walks the walk: adoption is a tough road under the best of circumstances. She has not made it easy on herself at all. She transformed pop culture with modest talent and a killer work ethic. All praise.
1838,Can we have an article on Cyndi Lauper as well?
1839,"Madonna, whatever. Some guys thinks she did the sheit for LGBTs and thats cool. As an artist, she didn't do anything for 20 years, as a musician, she never did anything. Like a female Michael Jackson, if that makes sense.(no, he didn't make his music, no)

How ever, we should never ridicule the effect and affect of someone famous.
Kardashjians comes to mind."
1840,"It's funny how someone who seems to want to portray herself as ""open"" always seems to be hiding from something.  

Is it her early childhood?  Fame?  Responsibility?  Lost youth? Rebellion?  AGING?!? Who knows.

The insomnia seems sad, too.  One of my greatest fears."
1841,"I was a girl growing up in the eighties and nineties, my family disintegrating while I was being abused at Catholic school. Madonna was always a part of my life, encouraging me to set my body free in dance, which I did. Unfortunately she was the only one in my world offering a critique of how the Catholic church treated girls and women. She critiqued with her body, through transgressions that today seem not so helpful. There is more than one way to resist patriarchy than by being promiscuous to the point of hurting yourself. She made me feel that the only way of resisting was with my body. I know she didn't intend this, but I thought that my faith had nothing to offer except as a set of symbols to transgress by greatly altering their meaning. As a writer, though, I owe her some gratitude for at least daring to speak out and to not be ashamed of her body. I am still reckoning with her influence."
1842,"Although I agree that the author of this article referenced her age too many times and she gave too many little details, I do think Madonna is slightly overreacting. In the article, she questions why talk about age at all. She is sixty and that's fact, she was and still is a revolutionary pop icon. But she seems to be coming to the realization that her time may be ending. Every day we wake up that is one day less here on earth, and Madonna doesn't want to age. She wants to halt the aging process. It's one of her very own insecurities and I understand that. Nonetheless, she should appreciate that such an article shed light into how a powerful--who was raped at 19--became a worldwide sensation and overcame much adversity and blossomed into an independent woman."
1843,"Madonna liked life before cell phones? I liked life before Madonna. She is NOT a positive role model, and contributed to our societal decline in morality by normalizing depravity. We are worse off, not better off, with Madonna."
1844,I guess it was the focus of the article but the author's incessant references to age detracted from my ability to glean insight into Madonna -- a woman who has changed the world (for better or worse). I know nothing more about her than I did before I read the article. I just know the author seems to be more interested in coming to grips with being a women as time passes.
1845,"There are many beloved celebrities, Elvis, Natalie Wood, James Dean, Kurt Cobain, Tupac Shakur, Marvin Gay, John Belushi, Chris Farley.,
 Farrah Fawcett, Ronnie Van Zant , it's a long list.
But these popular celebrities  all had one thing in common. They died before they became an aging old menace to their own popularity.
This is the case with Madonna, she was awesome in the 80s. But she's a bitter old dagger in the heart of her legacy now."
1846,"Beautiful,insightful piece. As a 62 year old woman, a lot of reminiscing for me. Why did Madonna hate the piece so much? I don?t get it. It feels like it captured her, whole."
1847,"It's a shame that people with obvious talent seem to be more consumed with the ""spectacle"" of it all, rather than the music.  Having fireworks and lesbian make-out sessions shouldn't define musicians but, unfortunately, does in this extended shallow age of musical nonsense.  There will always be the next big spectacle, which, every generation, seems to actually be even less musically talented."
1848,"Madonna is an artist and a chameleon ... and a magician. Somehow, when the fantastic ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" came out she was just a year younger than me. Then she was two years younger than me, and now she seems to be four years younger than me. Keep up your magic, Madonna but come on, own your age!"
1849,"I admire her business savvy and her eye for buying artworks.
Madonna did the yeoman's share of changing the landscape and giving young girls a strong role model. A zenith compared to the nadir being conjured up by the likes of Dworkin."
1850,"Always crafting a narrative?  Sounds like someone else we can't seem to escape.  She's talented, fine.  But I'm sorry, it is the over the top narcissism that overshadows everything else and is so unbecoming."
1851,"Here in NYC burbs we've seen countless people in their late 40's and 50's laid off in the past decade.  It's all about minimizing costs.    

Companies are laying off workers just as they approach what should have been their high earnings years - and just as their children are entering college.

We've seen people out of work for 2, 3, even 5 or more years.  those that find jobs are lucky to make half of what they used to earn.

This is a deliberate corporate policy.  You have people like Jamie Dimon making $33 million a year laying off hundreds, thousands and offshorig work to India.  NOBODY is worth that much money.   Think of all the people doing REAL work he eliminated to get that $33 million.

How can ANY economy function in the long term when there's absolutely no stability for the people that keep it functioning?"
1852,"Off-topic:  
Geneva, in response to your article today ""One Thing We Can Do: Balance Our Energy Demand"":
Here in California, there is enough solar power on the grid that it minimizes your CO2 production to use power during daylight hours if you can.  See today for example.  
<a href=""http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/emissions.aspx"" target=""_blank"">http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/emissions.aspx</a>
Note that 8:30 am to 1:30 pm are the periods of lowest CO2 production, even lower than midnight to 4 am.   
Similarly, net (total demand minus solar production) demand on the grid is lowest during daytime hours."
1853,"To the young ones who still have a chance, save as much as you can at every job and learn to cook. Calculate how much you earn per day e.g. $100/day and recall that number any time you want to buy something new. 

Remember how you feel working one full day and ask yourself if that item is worth it in exchange for your time, exhaustion, stress etc from being at your job for one day. Most of the time, it's a poor trade."
1854,"Joined the FIRE movement after my rich boss fired me to get away with stealing over $80k in independently verified earnings after 22 years of profitable highly productive work. I refuse to ever work making someone else wealthier again.

I'm in that age group where obtaining work is painful and humiliating, as many have attested to - let alone work under tear-inducing pain I'm left with after a spinal cord injury a few years ago.

Luckily I spent my entire working life maxing out my 401k and avoiding debt traps like the plague it is. Now I live like a true capitalist - freeloading off the work of others increasing the value of my modest IRA investments. I pay an early withdrawal tax penalty to trump's Fed on the small amounts I take from my IRA to get by. Fortunately it'll be penalty-free soon.

I also hate the idea of earning taxable income that would benefit the Right-To-Fire state that gave my employer the right to wrongfully terminate my livelihood and deprived me of the right to sue. Had the business remained in NY and not moved to NC I could have sued 'em.

PAIN is not a disability in the US! Go figure. I've not freeloaded on society, paying Obamacare premiums in full lucky to be self-sufficient. Fear of joblessness motivated me to sacrifice and save for many decades.

Now I do volunteer work that benefits animals - not people - as pain permits, and I indulge in learning as much as I can.

No more job search humiliations for me only to make the tax evading rich wealthier"
1855,"I have a little daughter, 11 now. I tell her almost daily that she must get very very good grades and become a medical professional consultant, like a cardiologist, neuroscientist, or something like that. Why? Because this is the ONE single profession where she would not be facing these recruiters, or other persons who who would be telling her that she lacks this, that or the other.
My husband has 2 technical degrees, an MBA, loads and loads of experience in his field and everytime there is a downturn in the economy he gets worried about losing his work and what will happen next--as he got laid off once and took 4 months to find the next role and that was also a contract. 
What was the trouble? The trouble was not his experience, not his education, but rather his age, his arabic style name, although he has lived almost al his lfe here in the west.
To each and every person I meet bearing foreign name, I tell them ONLY one thing, make sure your kid becomes a doctor, radiologist, nurse, dentist, i.e. anything in the medical field for none of these folks can be outsourced to India, China by these hungry corporations, and once you become a medical professional open your own medical practice and work in hospitals as consultants.. PERIOD. 
There is no respect by these corporations for a good hard working person in any field these days."
1856,"I recall filing an on-line application for a job where I fit the advertised requirements to a T.  I expected at least an interview, but no .... not a peep from the would-be employer.  I took the trouble to call, and was informed that I ""didn't fit"" the job requirements.
Got your Ph.D. in 1980? That, evidently, cancels everything else on your resume.  And good luck not giving dates on the application: The computers will refuse to accept it if you leave any field blank.  I suspect they've been programmed to filter out applicants based on dates."
1857,"Since the early 90's I had worked in law firm environments managing records and information, working in a ""right hand"" aspect, culling and gathering vital background material face-to-face with corporate attorneys. After 2008 when I was laid off, my rigorous job search stretched from one year to the next with no useful result. I was mystified at how recruiters could so quickly shrug off my accomplishments, those which had earned me bonus and ringing commendations. The reason was my age, apparently, and I was hung out to dry at age 55. Through the WIOA program I tried to access training which would further my prospects, only to learn that first I had to be working to quality (Catch-22!), and was further astonished to be told flatly by a counselor associated with the program that there was no recognized ""age discrimination"" in the job market. Further heartbreak led me over the next 2 years to devise a way for me to become self-employed. And so, what I advise my friends both young and old, is to seek self-sufficiency if possible. Because employers no longer care about the excellence you bring from years of toil, and, for the fresh-faced and young, value nothing save physical appearance and the extent to which they can burden one person with the duties of five. Oh, and that only until you reach the ripe old age of 40, whence they begin to plot your demise. None of us who've been refused is even being counted! Save yourselves!"
1858,"""I am not young enough to know everything,"" as J. M. Barrie wrote in ""The Admirable Crichton."" But I do know this: stereotyping is the greatest waste of human potential, whether it's older people denigrating the young or the young declaring that people over 50 ""don't get it.""

There's a story about a conversation between a 70-year-old grandfather and his digitally proficient teenage grandson. 
""You didn't grow up with all this computer stuff like I did, Gramps.""
""So, what's your point?""
""That you're not really computer savvy because you didn't have the benefit of all these great gadgets.""
""Yes,"" the grandfather replied, ""I know. That's why we had to invent them.""

It's what I call the ignorant myopia of arrogance -- when people see what they want to see (and hear what they want to hear). And in the process of being blind and deaf (and very dumb), we miss the opportunity to compound knowledge, to avoid mistakes, and leap ahead."
1859,"All of these stories resonate deeply.

Call my husband and I just two more casualties of 2008, two people in their late 50s and early 60s who have advanced degrees and decades of experience in tech with great references. Neither of us ever did find jobs again despite years of looking. Thankfully, we were frugal enough to be able to sell our home and move to a cheap state.We now get along on SS and limited retirement funds. But our plans and dreams were massacred, as was our peace of mind. We sure didn't move to KY because we want to live here.

""You don't fit the culture"" is code for ""you're too old."""
1860,"I am a middle-aged female professional who chairs job searches for upper-level positions regularly. I have lost count of the number of men over age 55 who tell me I should hire them because after X years of industry experience, they ""deserve"" the job. Further, they make no effort to demonstrate how their experience fits the position I am trying to fill. Sometimes their cover letters don't even mention my company, let alone the title of the position for which they are applying. 

Their attitude seems to be that their experience speaks for itself. Experience is extremely valuable, but if they can't take the time to research our company and stay current with technology and trends, I'd be a fool not to hire a less-seasoned but eager and talented applicant.

I'd advise the older gentlemen quoted in this story and the comments section to first examine whether they too might be bringing more than a whiff of entitlement to their job applications and interviews."
1861,"After being employed at a large engineering firm and at a public university, I did some temp work.  After some assignments I decided to apply to a private university and I was warned that the older I got (45) the less likely I would be able to find full-time employment.  Got lucky--stayed at the university for almost 20 years, saved my money and have been retired for 3 years and my investments are doing quite well.  You have to go where the work is and sometimes accept less than what you want -- I have an MBA and an MS in Human Resources."
1862,"I'm 49 and I find this article terrifying.

My peers and I arrived late to motherhood. At my same age, my parents had no more children at home. I still have 8 solid years left of parenting with kids at home. 

That means expenses. And I live in fear that if I were to lose my job that I could not find one of equal salary. And that is terrifying."
1863,"To get the severance package I needed, my former Wall Street employer had me sign away my right to participate in an age-related bias class action lawsuit. There were a lot of us over 40 terminated that day, two years ago."
1864,"I manage a segment of our company's business that requires the use of part-time technicians who are remotely based from our office. After completing their initial training, we rely on these individuals to work mostly autonomously to operate and maintain sophisticated air monitoring stations. The job requires attention to detail and willingness to respond quickly to investigate and resolve problems that can occur from time to time.

We pay these part-time techs a very competitive hourly wage and give them a lot of support, but I have discovered that retired or semi-retired technical professionals tend to be the best and most reliable employees for these positions. They seem to be more committed long-term to the job and do better quality work. 

I've noticed a much higher turnover in these positions with younger technical workers, who seem to forget all about the job commitment they pledged at the time of hire. (Turnover plays havoc with our business operations and budgets).

I greatly appreciate the values that older workers possess: commitment, reliability and a good work ethic."
1865,"These people who can't find jobs don't WANT to work, because they keep applying for jobs they're unlikely to get.  They just don't want to admit it.  When you WANT to work, you take the job you can get.  You take anything.  These people aren't doing that.  They're saying, ""I'm too good for that job.""  I'm an experienced computer programmer with an MBA.  When I was out of work a few years ago, I took a job delivering Chinese food on the weekends.  I ordered a take-out meal from a local Chinese restaurant and noticed a ""Help Wanted - Driver"" sign posted on the door.  When I was leaving, I saw the delivery guy getting out of his car.  I stopped and asked him about the sign.  He told me they needed someone to do deliveries at a different location.  I called the number and they told me to show up.  I showed up and was hired on the spot.  I did that job with an MBA.  I did it, because I wanted to work and I knew I could get that job immediately.  I did that job for a few months until I got a new job in my field.  Honestly, the Chinese food delivery job was a learning experience and I made okay money for what I was doing.  On a typical weekend, I would make around $250 cash - in my pocket.  I owned a house and was able to keep paying my bills.  I didn't keep a journal, because I was too busy working."
1866,"In my fifties, I was replaced by two pea-green recent college grads in an acquisitions position in publishing some years ago, despite my experience, advanced degree, and great reviews. My best friend? The EEOC. We went into mediation and I got a fine settlement. Not, I think, what I could have realized in court, but I was loath to face the expense and nastiness that would have entailed. Now though, I wish I had. Take it to the streets, people."
1867,"So I own a small business. My husband is 58, and has been working like crazy for 2.5 years to find a job. He goes on lots of interviews, and is sometimes called back for round 2. But so far, all he's been able to get is a part-time gig that pays 80k less than he was making in his previous FT job and has no benefits. I myself am 52. So I feel the agism acutely. It's real. But I am also an employer. I've hired numerous older workers. Not one of them works out, and I'm starting to develop a bias against applicants my own age. When you hire someone in their 50s for an entry level job, you discover WHY they have worked for decades and never been promoted. Many of them have attitude problems. They can't take direction to save their lives. They have a sense of entitlement. Their interpersonal skills and work ethic are poor. And the key thing I see in these workers - and in my own spouse - is a shocking lack of judgment. They post inappropriate things online. They say inappropriate things to colleagues. They call in sick, but post their beach photos that day. Their emails are tone deaf. They watch movies, shop or play games online, or fiddle with their cell phones, when they're supposed to be working. I have seen some of this behavior in younger workers, but usually not. These types of problems are consistent among my over 50 hires; I've only seen it in two millennials I've hired. As real as age discrimination is, out of work older people may be out for good reason."
1868,"Older workers are generally considered to be more expensive than younger workers.  But here is my question:  Why is employment assumed to be all or nothing proposition?  After their home is paid off and their kids have finished college, how many older employees would be willing to ""downsize"" to a part-time schedule?  I'd bet quite a few.   It is unfortunate that the current method of effecting this is to toss them out the door.  It would be better to have this built into the system."
1869,"I'm way too old and too poorly educated to be hired for any sort of job. I never got past the first semester of community college. But I can write and I've got an independent, entrepreneurial nature. So I founded a professional writing service. I do very well with it, and so do my 11 writers. Do what you're good at and strike out on your own if need be. Good luck."
1870,"Sending resumes don't work, nor does networking, at least for me. What does, and has worked for me for decades, is getting recruiters to call me. Not for everyone, and easier said than done. Even with my in-demand skill set, the last time I had to look for work was 2018, I had interviews at 16 companies, only 2 from companies I submitted a resume to, and 30 others that went into the bin, many of which I was overqualified for.

I realized this back in 2003, after being unemployed for a year, laid off in a merger and during a recession, with a skill set that I had thought was strong, technology team project management. After very few calls, and even working administrative assistant jobs just to keep busy, I eventually reduced my LinkedIn headline simply Excel Expert. I had a call the next day, and a job shortly afterward, and something much broader than what I touted myself as.

Recruiters have a set of requirements for a job, and they aren't interested in your breadth of experience unless it satisfies the role they are hiring for. It's not that ageism doesn't exist, but it is not going away, and our elected officials don't seem too concerned about changing it."
1871,"The published responses to this and some of the comments are so frustrating. I 100% agree that ageism is a problem, and having worked briefly in a law office, all forms of discrimination are running rampant - and many lawyers don't want to take them on because lawsuits are time-consuming and costly. Yes, something has to be done about that. That being said, where are all of the gig workers? Are we just too tired and beat to contribute to the conversation (or, like me, no longer able to read as many articles as I'd like because I've trimmed out my NYTimes subscription?). I have a grad degree and have been working multiple jobs ever since I graduated undergrad. I have ongoing job alerts from all of the major job boards. I am crushed under debt I cannot pay off. I can't tell you how many jobs I've applied for the past couple of years and how many gigs I've leveled-up from, hoping soon I'll make enough to do more than break even. Still, I am hardly making enough to get by, my rent has literally quadrupled in my city in five years, and I live in a relatively small southern town. I'm worried about how sedentary I've become - despite efforts to work out regularly - because I so often have to be working at my laptop. This is a major American problem, no matter your age or profession. We are overworked and underpaid, and many of us are dying because we can't afford to live in safe places or to access to healthcare (I haven't had dental in years). Rampant inequity must be dealt with."
1872,"Perhaps the most demoralizing aspects of prolonged unemployment is when well-meaning(?) family, friends, and strangers insist it's all your own fault: ""You're just not looking hard enough."" ""If you'd put in a little more effort, you'd have a job."" 

Then there are the myriad ""experts"" on the Internet offering contradictory advice about everything from resume formats to interview attire. Sometimes it's merely absurd: ""Put on a necktie as soon as you get up in the morning and don't take it off until bedtime. Wearing a tie gives you the professional confidence you need to land a job.""

The one thing all the ""experts"" agree on is that networking is the key to finding a job. In the age of robots casting applications into black holes, this may actually be true. But of course, the ""experts"" take this advice to absurd lengths: ""You need to spend every waking moment networking. Treat every person you meet as a source of Advice, Information, and Referral to someone who may know someone in the company you want to work for. But you have charm them, so you don't look like you're a desperate job seeker looking for leads."" 

The unfortunate reality is that the hiring practices at nearly all American employers are severely broken. It's a game in which every employer plays by different rules that are usually impossible for a job seeker to discern, so there is no reliable advice. The only certainty is that age is one of a number of conditions that make the job hunt even more difficult."
1873,"While it's an attractive design, the photo at the top of the page is offensively misleading. The notebooks are messy and disorganized. That is not how people of any age organize their job search. Shocking news: We 55 are quite familiar with computers and (gasp!) spreadsheets."
1874,"What kind of funding did you have when you started off on your own as ""self-employed"" and/or a business owner, Julie Zuckerman, and why would you expect an unemployed college graduate drowning in student loan debt to be able to come up with ANY money to open their own business?  They can't even afford to move out of their parents' home!"
1875,"Age discrimination is nothing new, but one thing that has made it worse is the obsessive infantilizing by corporations of their employees to make make them more pliable and docile. Forced socializing and ""team building"" have transformed the workplace into a giant preschool. Is it any wonder that the kids don't want to hang out with grownups?"
1876,"""Giving special consideration at elite schools to black applicants who have a high probability of success in college...""

How do you define the probability of success? To bring students into the ""upper middle class"" through affirmative action it surely must matter which majors they get to enroll in.  An A in African American, ethnic  etc studies cannot be compared to an A in Statistical Thermodynamics  or Human Anatomy - it requires limited skills, capacity or effort and the degree is not that useful. 

A precondition for  AA should be that one gets to study a   subject that will lead to a meaningful and productive career. Preferably STEM, law, business or medicine.  "
1877,It seems that the only time that most people have a  problem with  affirmative action is when its benefits Black people. This is pure hatred.
1878,I found his answers to be reductive and less than compelling.  Affirmative action in the best schools has become nothing more than a way to guarantee the children of the black 1 percent professional class remain there.  That doesn't seem like enough of a reason given the problems it causes  for Asian Americans especially the horrible downgrading of them on social criteria which smacks of the similar anti semitic process in the 1920's.
1879,"We don?t need affirmative action anymore. No one will be denied access to a school based on the color of their skin. This is an antiquated policy and like other antiquated institutions we eliminated them. Time for this to
Go as well. The professor?s answers sounded hollow and illogical."
1880,"Affirmative action has been, and remains, the perfect system for our society's elites to insulate their own offspring from competition from below while requiring whites - read usually white males - to wear the proverbial hair shirt and have their ambitions flushed down the toilet so the elites can have their tony wine-and-cheese party bragging rights.  The only way it will ever acquire even a modicum of credibility is when those whose waxing ecstatic is the most vigorous are also the ones who tell their sons, daughters, nieces and nephews that their academic and professional ambitions must be sacrificed to help disadvantaged blacks.  Pigs will fly before that ever happens."
1881,"The reality is that elite university admissions staff DOES take into account all the advantages and disadvantages every applicant experiences on their life's path to application.  All 'affirmative action' does is make it explicit that black applicants face disadvantages growing up in America.

The people who object to 'affirmative action' in elite college admissions are taking shots at a straw man.  It simply isn't the case that any elite universities are admitting all their top X number of black applicants to ensure that Y percent of their student body is black.  And of course the white kid who just misses out on Harvard will get admitted to Columbia, so boo-hoo.

Rather, the admissions staff is holistically reviewing all the applications before them and is trying to piece together the best student body for their school.  After all, the ultimate success of the graduates is what makes these schools elite in the first place.

As long as an admissions staff doesn't engage in invidious discrimination, such as excluding students of a particular race, or LGBTQ, or physically disabled, then the public should simply BUTT OUT of elite college admissions.

In the end, objections to affirmative action seem to reflect white discomfort with the fact of persistent racial discrimination in American society being made explicit.  Suck it up, buttercup."
1882,"Affirmative action like welfare is destructive,for the people it aims to help.It?s time African Americans stand on their own two feet & help themselves.No one helped the Jews, Irish, & Italians to escape from the slums & poverty, why should we treat them like the misfits of our Society. It has already illustrate that they can help themselves by the number of successful African Americans, who have shown they have the intelligence to compete & win in all phases of life."
1883,"I like the term affirmative action, but  would like to see it happen way before college.
Why are so many Black Americans good at sports? At music? African Americans are disproportionately successful in these fields.
Is this because of some innate, genetic superiority? If you believe that, you're opening the door to the idea that whites are ""superior"" intellectually, based on their achievements in science, technology, etc.
But Blacks' success in sports and music is not based on superior genes, it's based on dedication to achievement that begins at an early age. Just like White success in intellectual activities comes from reinforcement at a very young age of intellectual pursuits like reading and math.
The rest is statistics. If 90% of Black boys practice hard at sports because they are inspired by role models who've been successful 
- or shut out of intellectual pursuits - then 10% will become great at what they do. 
If 90% of White kids read and do math from a very young age, then 10% of them will be great at intellectual stuff.
Most Whites are not Einsteins or Wittgensteins (oops, they're Jewish, another can of worms...) and most Blacks aren't pro athletes or musical geniuses. 
Point is, it's the culture, not the genes. Affirm intellectual pursuits from an early age to everyone in the community (not a select few) and Blacks will catch up in no time."
1884,"East Asian, south Asian, middle eastern. All are lumped in with whites when we talk about what ?We? have done to blacks. Heck, many times Hispanics are also lumped in. 

These policies, **when executed on the basis of race alone** can increase feelings of racial division and racial animosity. By definition it?s discrimination.   It?s hard to accept as a fair policy to all. "
1885,"It is very telling that Mr. Gutting chose to avoid questions about how Affirmative Action hurts Asian American applicants.  He justifies discrimination against white applicants but cannot bring himself into justifying that Asians should ""take a hit for the team"" despite growing up with racism themselves.  

I guess the mental gymnastics required to argue that Affirmative Action does not discriminate against Asian Americans is still too hard, even for a college professor."
1886,"I Still Believe That Affirmative Action Can Make Unequals Equal, Sort Of"
1887,"Prof. Gutting wants affirmative action for ""blacks,"" no matter what their class or national origin.  Okay.  Define ""black.""  I've seen too many schools and employers trying to promote mixed-race and even partially black whites as ""blacks"" in order to make themselves look good and get the government off their backs.  People like that don't look ""black"" and are NOT disadvantaged.  It's as much of a scam as giving affirmative action to ""white"" Hispanics."
1888,"You'll have to take me at my word on this, but almost forty years ago my brother was admitted to med school, then bumped because a woman wanted in.  

My recent ex-fiance' has two uber-brilliant ""kids."" Ultra high achievers in advanced high school programs. Award after award. Older daughter was admitted to MIT on almost a full ride of grants and scholarships.  Son was admitted to most top tier schools, but the financial packages sucked.  (Mom makes about $45K/yr.) A number of relatives of his were Rice alumni and he got admitted.........with almost no aid as one for instance.  Did not get into Harvard, despite the much vaunted legacy ""problem,"" his dad is alumni.

While knocking 'em dead academically in high school, he also worked about 15 hrs/wk as a MECHANIC, so much for diversity of experience. 

He is at University of Texas in an advanced program in the engineering school.  First semester just passed, took a full load of sophomore year classes.

I'm old school liberal, but don't tell me there isn't reverse discrimination.  "
1889,"It would be one thing if for an entering class at a prestigious U if there were some sort of lottery that gave an advantage to Blacks.  For example -- let's say the entering class is 1000.  The top 600 applicants are offered a place in the class.  Let's then say that the next 2000 students are statistically indistinct from each other -- the slight differences in their GPAs, SAT's, outside interests are not predictive in terms of how they will do in college.  So let's say in the first 600, you have 30 Blacks -- or 5%.  So you decide that for the next 400, you'll give 15% of the offers to Blacks -- for a total of 60.  That gives you 90 total or 9%.  It's only a slight advantage and no one could really complain as the credentials were roughly equal. 

That is a far cry, however, from accepting people who have GPA's and SAT's that are way below what other applicants have simply because of their race -- so that instead of filling out your class of 1000 from the top 2600 applicants -- you are going to a level that is several thousand applicants below that where the odds of academic success diminish dramatically.   

I could endorse something akin to the first model.  The second is ridiculous


 "
1890,"The back and forth responses here are interesting and illuminating.

What seems missing is any acknowledgment of a basic principle of fundamental fairness: Two wrongs do not make a right.

Of course there are in practice exceptions to this principle:
A deep, longstanding and unjust wrong can justify a small temporary corrective wrongs. 
A last-resort and kept-to-a-minimum wrong can be justified by its warding off some much worse wrong.

Affirmative action is nowhere near fitting with such exceptional exceptions. 

Of course, diversity within a student body is a worthy goal. And, of course, no admissions procedure can ever be completely objective and unbiased. However, neither of these two considerations can justify affirmative action as we have known it in America. Using skin color to systematically discriminate is not fundamentally pro-diversity, it is fundamentally racist.

Facts on the ground on also matter. Affirmative action has always been inherently tokenist. Tiny minorities within a few ethnic groups benefit at the expense of tiny minorities of others. Furthermore, historical wrongs are righted by creating a long history of newer wrongs. This is patent inconsistency for the sake of superficiality. What we have can no longer be regarded as a temporary counter-tilting of playing fields. Instead, affirmative action has become a new eternal paean to the spirit of George Wallace: 

Reverse discrimination now, reverse discrimination tomorrow, reverse discrimination forever."
1891,"""Of course, we can?t simply ignore poor Chinese immigrants and other disadvantaged groups, but overall we?ve treated blacks much more badly than we have other groups, so there?s a more compelling case for them.""
Affirmative action will never be ""fair"" unless it is given to all
groups. And that will never happen.The good professor obviously is not familiar with the terrible anti Chinese events
that happened in the West in the last two hundred years. Or
maybe they don't figure into his thesis.Anyhow they happened and are a bad part of history. To blithely  ignore these events
and say that blacks were treated worse for longer and that
they are more deserving of AA seems to me to be way too
easy an answer to the problem.
What we must realize with AA is that we are picking winners
and losers here. And this will always be the basic problem with AA. And I don't see any way around that.




"
1892,"The fact is that wealthy well connected White people benefit from affirmative action all day, everyday.  On the contrary, people of color, of all economic classes, in particular, Black Americans, still suffer from the subtle and pernicious effects of discrimination.  Moreover, Black Americans still suffer from the vehement , crippling, rapacious legacy of slavery that still has current ramifications.

 While we live in a racially diverse and pluralistic society, our nations history, past and present  has been anything but. Our current political environment should make this clear to thinking person. Thus, we still need affirmative action policies for the forseeable future.  "
1893,"In the age of Cloud and virtual everything, isn't it time for colleges to scale up? I was admitted to a great school fully accredited in both Canada and the USA for an MBA. The school, Athabasca University in Alberta Canada runs it programming completely virtual and accepts as many students whom are are qualified as apply. The school simply splits the class up into as many cohorts of smaller workgroups of students as required. It was as personal and rich as my experience I had in a bricks and mortar undergrad school and prepared me perfectly for self driven work and discovery  from wherever I happen to be. It was an almost 100% raceless experience. We worked within our rotating cohorts as a team with no sense of prejudice or race, only contributing to the team's goals. The experience actually forced you to accept everyone and to engage regardless of race. A situation not very likely on a campus."
1894,"According to black authors Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele, AA is wrongheaded because it forces top schools to admit underprepared black kids who soon fail and are kicked out.  Since there are over 3,000 school choices in the U.S., kids should seek a school of there own level."
1895,"The author essentially ignores the last question:

Q:  Why not give affirmative action based on social disadvantage rather than based on race?

A:  We can't right all wrongs simultaneously.  

So instead we need to protect the status quo policy where the advantages of affirmative action mostly flow to affluent African-Americans and first and second generation African immigrants?  

A intellectually honest proponent of affirmative action (who like the author is a utilitarian who believes in ""the means justify the ends"" to justify this kind of social engineering and reverse discrimination) would not propose a social policy where people are sorted by how they simply check one of 4 boxes (white, black, hispanic, or asian).   

But the author isn't quite there yet obviously.  In fact, I think the author would probably support reparations payable to Barack Obama (a very wealthy black man who is not a descendant of slaves) based on the justifications presented.  I think that would be nuts of course, but could be justified per the author's point of view that the paramount policy goal is ""more black surgeons""."
1896,"If people in the States are anything like people in the UK, affirmative action can be a poisoned chalice for those said to be benefiting from it. In my Uni it was common belief that black students were only there because of some PC programme (or on a sports scholarship) - in fact, coming into Uni on a minority scholarship programme was a bit like having a neon sign held over you flashing: Charity case. "
1897,"Talk is cheap.  If Gary Gutting really believed what he was saying he'd resign his position at Notre Dame and start driving a cab.  He would encourage his children to do the same.  Somehow I don't think he will do that.  He advocates that poor White Protestants, a group less represented at Harvard than Blacks, should be discriminated against.  Somebody else, like Asians, should pay for his charity.  I patiently await word of his resignation.  "
1898,"""...verall we?ve treated blacks much more badly than we have other groups, so there?s a more compelling case for them.""

And there is is, the real reason for affirmative action. It is ""compensation"" for historic injustice, a debt to be paid my today's population for actions taken 150 years ago. In other words, is is a race debt - a concept that is a racist as anything out there. Affirmative action is heinous racism, period. Abolish it."
1899,"So Gutting's argument is 1)  Certain groups have suffered injustice/ are currently suffered injustice.  2)  To compensate them, we should take from other groups to make up for their injustice.  The groups that we take from include groups that have done nothing to inflict this injustice on the first group.  This is the main reason why people feel affirmative action isn't fair.  You don't steal to make up for getting robbed."
1900,I agree with Chief Justice Roberts who said the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race. That is precisely what affirmative action does because somebody gets shafted. So who do you want to get shafted?
1901,I find it deeply depressing that anyone feels like they need to rebut this infantile racist nonsense.  And I can't help but think that if we talked about economics & class & power as much as we talked about race & identity then it would be even more obvious than it is that the racial make-up of the society means nothing.  Race is a myth. Racism is an easy way to manipulate frustrated people.  But it's power & money that create the frustration and do the manipulating.

White people definitely 'lost' neighborhoods, schools, and businesses, not to mention city government, the police, etc.  The city lost 1.2 million people, for crying out loud, and nobody wants to talk about it.  

If you once called Detroit your 'home' then had to leave it because it was too unsafe, unattractive, or because the schools stank, you wouldn't want to hear sanctimonious analyzer Farhad Manjoo preaching to you about how you were buying into some prejudicial myth of ""existential decline.""  You would just want to live your life, go to work, and send your kids to a halfway decent school.  It's not that complicated.  

What happened in Detroit was a tragedy and very sad, with plenty of blame to go around.  But to the extent Detroit reflects racial politics and demographic change, it actually was, in fact, a sort of ""existential decline.""  So don't tell some guy who once owned a halfway decent house in Detroit that he's believing some prejudicial myth of ""existential decline.""  He's the one who had to up and move, not Farhad Manjoo."

1906,"Before whites go on a lament about being inundated with non-whites, they examine their own bonafides by examining their superracist definition of ""white.""

1908,"In order to survive any species must evolve. So note how white supremacism has evolved over the years.

The KKK simply declared they were superior people, and so it was OK to take ?uppity? people of other races out to the edge of town and lynch them. That doesn?t work anymore, so the new appeal is that whites are now victims themselves. Part of this results from the supremacists' need to reposition themselves to sell a new pitch to their fellow whites. The arguments are now things like, ?Hey, don?t you feel like you?re being discriminated against just because you?re white? Isn?t this so unfair?? Mr. Manjoo does a good job of calling out this pathetic self-victimization and describing it as ?bonkers.?

It?s especially ironic that many of these whites are the descendants of immigrants who arrived here in the 1800s from places like Germany, Ireland, Poland, and Italy. The white Mayflower descendant-types feared them back then because they spoke languages other than English and because they had other religions such as Catholicism. Yet their arrival was hardly the ruin of American society; they became part of our nation and helped build our modern America.

Yet the descendants of those hard-working immigrants now want to sit back and be entitled. Hopefully the rest of us (I should disclose that I?m a white guy myself) can ignore them and get our country going again. But an obstacle for us is that our president is an entitled white guy himself who appeals to their worst instincts."

But so is every other catagory of people,  depending on how we choose to classify and label them. The only non-pigmented people are people with albinism and even they can have some coloring.

So we now have at least Asian in our otherwise all-Euro-white blood line going back to at least the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and undoubtedly further.

Everyone was white where my father and most of his siblings were born on a homestead in Alberta, and all 10 of those siblings grew up much as I did-?never encountering Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, Arabians or whatever. And none of my own three siblings ever married. Our town was pretty all-white when my hormones carried me into marriage. I was already married when I had my first-ever Black classmate, in college, and I was on the doorsill of the altar when I acquired my first Hispanic friends in he Army.

I like the idea of the US trying to help a country, say Guatemala,  IN SITU, so that people are less likely to want to move.  That is definitely a solution!

The other possibility is through international education!

We are talking about ""Manhattan Projects "" in both cases with new ideas (paradigm shifts). Add climate change and our work is cut out for us!

1938,"If the writer was only a preteen when Trump debuted on The Apprentice, that would explain why he though Trump was ""only fun."" Any suitably skeptical adult instantly recognized a grifter and  a sleazebag. Residents of New York and New Jersey already knew him well from his long string of incompetently managed scams and malfeasance: he went to TV because banks would no longer lend him money. Though it does seem that he has done reasonably well with certain foreign banks...."
1939,"I never liked Trump as far back as the 1980s: the egotism, the trashy flashy buildings, the hype, the incessant lying. Despite that, I found the 2004 photos of Trump shocking. They show a reasonably attractive older man who looks almost presidential. The 2019 photos that we endure every day in the NYT and WPost now show a deeply damaged shell of a human being, a black hole of hate and aggression. The mere passage of 15 years isn't enough to account for it. I'm the same age as Trump, and have numerous friends the same age or older, so I assure you that his appearance (and of course, his behavior) is profoundly abnormal."
1940,"Having always found myself retching at the sound of Donald Trump's name, I never watched The Apprentice. I'm glad to read this background of how he exploited the buried tensions of American culture to vault himself onto that escalator and ruin all our lives."
1941,"Mirrors, just to be clear, do not 'bend-space time'.  They merely distort images."
1942,Did anyone actually apprentice?
1943,Excellent analysis. Trump wants liberals to hate Republicans and vice versa. Americans need to reach out to each other to overcome this man. One way or another
1944,"I never saw a single episode of this garbage.
And I didn't have to to know Trump is as fake as his shows were.

Reality TV is the death of thinking, nothing about them is real. Hours of footage is carefully edited for drama and tension, it's all carefully scripted make-believe.

Trump is proof Americans like to watch a train wreck."
1945,"The author confuses his youthful naivety with Trump being only funny mean.  Donald Trump has been deeply mean, hatefilled, and immoral his entire adult life."
1946,"As W.C.Fields or P.T.Barnum once said, ""Never give a sucker an even break."" That is, if it turns out that we, the people, are the clown show that is too unfocused to effectively oppose him, Trump and the Republicans will take us for everything we've got and leave our vulture-picked-over bones to bleach in the sun.  Who's laughing now?"
1947,So why isn't Jerry Springer president?
1948,I don?t get it not the article The Apprentice.
1949,Mean is never funny.
1950,"Honestly, I have no recollection of ever watching the apprentice or even knowing much about it.  I think that those who did watch it were silly fools.  And they have inflicted upon the rest us this despicable demagogue.  Shame on all of you."
1951,"This isn't only about young men...this is about all white men.

Just listen to the Terry Gross ""Fresh Air"" interview with Cambridge Analytica whistle blower Christopher Wiley,  or read his new book,  and you will see how Steve Bannon and C.A. - with a lot of help from Facebook - targeted disenfranchised white men, of all income levels, in order to poison the well of voters in the 2016 election.

That's in addition to targeting people of color and others in order to manipulate or discourage voting. 

The depth, breadth and magnitude of it is...frightening.

Targeting young men is an extension of the older men that were initially targeted pre-2016, this has been happening for a while...and right now it's impacting the 2020 election.

If you think I'm being dramatic...just listen to the interview.

These are precarious times; its up to us as individuals to set aside our smart phones and social media, out our house in order, and focus our time,energy, and attention on righting our relationships, helping our communities and our country, and reconnecting to our humanity.

""What I do for me, I do for humanity."" Wise words to live by."
1952,"whiteness, in and of itself, does not signify 
a history of racism and intolerance. while 
the writer is teaching her kids about the 
perils of alt right and supremacist websites, 
she should also instruct them about the 
great artistic,humanistic and scientific 
contributions of western civilization and
not be afraid of pointing out that these
were the achievements of white people,
most of whom were decent and tolerant."
1953,"Unfortunately looks like my other comments didn't get approved, so I'll keep this one short.  If you want to know why it's so easy for ""white supremacists"" to recruit, simply ignore the article itself and instead browse the comments section here."
1954,"Teach them from an early age to be an individual, to detect and avoid group think of whatever ideology, to think for themselves, and to respect other people?s right to do the same.    Teach critical thinking?you will probably have to brush up on it yourself?we all get lazy.  Learn to just ask ?Why do you think that.?

Be willing to entertain some uncomfortable ideas as you teach them to seek the truth independently.  They may come to some different conclusions than you do, but each generation grows up in a different world and sees it differently.   If you only brainwash them to think what you think is right, they will be unarmed.  

I read Mao, Lenin, Mein Kampf, and much other radical literature when I was 13.  I didn?t become a Nazi or a Revolutionary.  I became a skeptic and a Rotarian."
1955,"I wonder how many teens are 'recruited' by LGBTQ on-line persona and led to declare they are ""non-binary"", ""trans-sexual"", ""pan-sexual"" or whatever just to fall in line with what the on-line trolls want."
1956,"important article, feels too tho like we need to understand who's funding these alt right groups, it feels systemic and organized, increasingly aggressive and is literally and figuratively weaponizing young men in ways similar to other terrorist groups, with apparent linkages to the NRA, Russia, the current WH..."
1957,"These alt-right groups are stupid and corrosive. But the door is opened by our own liberal excesses. Every time they can point to where we have over-reached, become intolerant, judgmental or created facts out of thin air we give them the tools to recruit. And our sins are legion."
1958,"I?m a veteran, my wife is a veteran, and my brother-in-law is veteran Green Beret.  We?re nauseated every time we see these white nationalist ?patriot? frauds, dressed in camo and heavily armed.  Their collective ignorance and hate, fueled by vile conspiracy theories, is almost like a form of American ISIS.  They?re actually a pack of cowards, unable to honorably engage the political process and work within our democratic system.  Law enforcement needs to keep an eye on them and their recruiting programs need to be countered by real patriots."
1959,"White supremacist movements also include women.  So it's important for parents to watch all of their white children, not just their sons."
1960,"Make no mistake about it. This is Donald Trump's fight.
Just look at his rallies. 
The yelling. The anger. The hate.
The overwhelmingly white faces screaming for more.
Looks like Nuremberg.
Or the next Civil War."
1961,"The reason your sons are falling prey to ""white supremacists"" isn't bc you aren't taking about race.  You talk about race all the time.  But only context of how people that look like them have done terrible things.  You're trying to make them act out of guilt over things they haven't done.  And they have eyes.  They know that right now, in the current year,  people of every race are doing terrible things.  Ignoring that fact makes them resent you and look elsewhere.  That's whats taking control out of your hands."
1962,"The writer does not define what constitutes ""white."" How do I know if I have a white son or daughter? How much pigmentation is too much?"
1963,"Just do the best you can, okay? Just do the best you can."
1964,"Racist groups come in all colors.  It isn't just the white kids who have to ""watch out""....it's also the minority kids who are preyed on by their racist groups."
1965,This will be read as parody in five years.
1966,"The amount of Russian KGB government paid for postings in the US and Europe to create hate and division is enormous.  Sadly we have few federal resources countering this cyber infestation as Trump is the beneficiary.

Look for signs, comments of gender, anti-women jokes (the stupid old ""women cannot drive"") inferior by sex non-sense. Also popular, ""men are not macho like the good old days"".

Also listen for... ""you don't understand our humor, your not funny"". There has been a thriving postings of anti women and weak men ""jokes"" and so bizarre is the evidence that children are taught all of these old disgusting stereotypes with memes etc...so that the alt-right will have a ""secret only we know the jokes"" connection with your child. Ewe!

Listen for the ""all those people"" sentences when the child discusses race, sex, religion.  This extremism comes from the crazy on the right and crazy on the left, lets be honest, extremists want to over-simplify and judge to support their ""cause"".

We are all Americans and with a real President this will be addressed."
1967,It might be easier to dissuade young white men from developing an interest in the alt-right if the left had not decided that the only race-and-gender group exempt from the usual and appropriate rules against generalized attacks are white males - as demonstrated by the phrases ?white male patriarchy? and ?toxic masculinity.?
1968,"Yes, the world has constant negative influences and always will. It's the job of the parents to ensure their children grow up knowing what is right and what is wrong. The internet is a tool like anything else. Unfortunately, many people use it for terrible things. This article is ridiculous."
1969,"Someone (in addition to Elizabeth Warren) needs to call out social networking giants like Facebook and Google in this issue.  They make philosophical arguments about free speech, but they, in the end, take little responsibility for the damage their platforms do.  Perhaps they should allow false and hateful ads in the name of free speech, but they should use all of the profits from hate speech to produce their own ads countering misinformation and hate.  How about from every ad favoring Nazi?s, there is a specific ad running on the same website specifically countering it.

After all, free speech is different from a free-for-all!"
1970,"In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available,there were 8,437 hate crimes. Whites were known offenders in 3,228 of these hate crimes. Whites make up 76.5 percent of the population, but only 33.26 percent of known hate crimes offenders. 

Whites commit a disproportionately small percent of hate crimes. This suggest white parents are doing a better job than nonwhite parents at raising chidden not to commit hate crimes.

1971,I beg to differ with the author's explanation that white nationalists and alt-right merely want to dominate people of other races and ethnicities.  The goal of the alt right and white nationalists is to eliminate by genocide all people of color and Jews.  That message is not up front in their memes but it expressed in their literature and their heroes who periodically shoot up public spaces and most recently synagogues and Black churches.  Certainly our sons will understand that the road to racist genocide is not the path they would chose.
1972,"Race is a made up concept that holds that appearances defines people right down through all their characteristics as biological organisms and it?s all false. It?s a form of drawing generalizations from a small and insignificant set of examples which is demonstrably false. 

Teenagers are inexperienced and often misunderstand the real significance of many things. To avoid having them misled by deluded or manipulative people requires big efforts to enlighten them in ways that their level of maturity makes difficult.

We as a nation need to confront the fact that race is a false concept, that it does not represent enough about people to predict what to expect from them. It has been used to justify unjust and exploiting other people, and that is something we must never forget.

Currently, people still reacting with anger towards racism in the country are asserting false narratives about white people all being racists or privileged due to racism in order to instill shame and guilt. It reflects a righteous indignation towards real injustices but it targets the wrong people. Teenagers are going to hear this not as anger toward past wrongs but demeaning themselves for things which they had no part in. The stereotyping by race needs to end."
1973,I grew up without the internet but all my friends and I  never felt that we were under threat from other ethnics or races and we just got along with all our peers regardless of religion  or anything else. We had Catholic teachers in a Jewish community our friendships were not limited by religion. The social media is a negative force in our daily lives like Trump using Twitter to promote policy. If we were to go back to the good old days of MAGA we would reject everything that comes from Trump's lies.
1974,"Seems their recruiting methods are quite similar to those used by ISIS.  We should treat them in the same manner, as they lead down similar roads.   And before I get attacked by the 1st Amendment zealots, please remember that your rights end precisely where everyone else's rights begin."
1975,"One might add when discussing this topic with their sons that going down this rabbit hole will make it ten times more difficult for them to find a girlfriend, and then explain why. I'd expect this fact to be quite relevant to many of them."
1976,"Mind-boggling incompetence shown here. The witness never saw the suspect steal the watches. Then she is asked to compare what she saw on a ""grainy"" video to six pictures? Eyewitness identification (which this is actually not) is one of the worst investigative tools around and has been shown to be wrong in too many cases. I'm surprised the warrant application got past the detective's supervisor and then the judge who had to sign off on the warrant. If it was me I'd definitely sue for false arrest. The two detectives working this case should be writing parking parking tickets and nothing else."
1977,"It's very distracting to hear Annie Brown's inflections, verbage, and modulation that's painfully similar to Michael Barbaro."
1978,"With all due respect, I think you got this story wrong. I’m surprised by the Daily on this one because the headline made me anticipate some nefarious technology. But what I got instead was a story of shoddy police work blamed on technology rather than laziness. This isn’t some algorithm gone wrong. The algorithm isn’t biased against black people, the police officers are. The service was sold (and purchased) using incomplete data. This isn’t biased computer language. I think talking about how this algorithm is biased rather than limited is shifting blame to where it shouldn’t be. This story should be about biased, shoddy police work. This is about lazy detective work. It’s about a biased system that would allow them to get an arrest warrant without any other police work. Shame on this police department, and the warrant issuer for allowing so little to inform them. Come on Daily, you missed an opportunity here by not focusing on how this would not likely have happened to a white man, not because of the algorithm, but because the police force doesn’t see all white men as the same and the warrant issuer would have asked for additional detective work. You generally treat us as smarter than this."
1979,"i really am not able to comprehend how they can give a bias to him. it's not normal and we shouldn't normalize it. if we, such incidents are going to increase day by day. just because he is a black people it does not mean that he is a criminal. that officers' behaviour is called 'bigotry' and 'racism' basically."
1980,The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) needs to set some standards on facial recognition software.  They have already done the research.
1981,"We need to use this technology to control our nuclear weapons.

There may be mistakes, but ar least we don't have to think about it."
1982,"Where to begin appreciating this fine and unbiased reporting! Let's start with the initial premise of whether or not a algorithm can be biased, specifically black people.

The reporters note that the security officer of the store that was robbed (civilian) was used as the final decision making point to issue an arrest. So, not only did the cop misspoke, but NYTs 10 year veteran tech reporter fails to connect the dots that a human was at the trigger in this failure of civil liberities, not a racist computer. The human had the final say and the human was wrong.

I looked the accuracy rate of facial recognition software according to NIST. The best accuracy rate was about 99.5%. I think it's fair to say that these algorithms are pretty accurate. Mistakes can still be made, but they are exceedingly rare. And they will get better.

What really grinds my gears is that the reporters here at NYT wants you to feel that this is systemic racism and uses a series of emotional quotes from the victim and and his family to make you feel bad for them.

Rather than propose proper justice for the man falsely accuses, say monetary compensation, formal apology to the man's company and social circles to restore his dignity. Detroit Police caved to societal pressure and decides that a ~99% accuracy algorithm with human intervention is not PC and stopped using it.

Destructive societal behaviors combined with a biased media is the downfall of USA, not Trump voters and Republicans."
1983,"This story needs to be taken further. Yes, there are legitimate issues and concerns about the software that need to be explored but the software is just a tool. A facial rec hit should never alone be enough for a warrant. How did police get the warrant? Was there any due diligence? It is the process after the use of technology that needs to be scrutinized just as much because it is those possible mistakes that may happen with or without technology."
1984,"Mr. Williams should definitely sue them, if not for himself, then to start creating a record demonstrating the police abuse of this so-called technology."
1985,"Horrifying.  An innocent, hard working, upstanding citizen is arrested, his young daughter traumatized.  No apology from the justice system.  Only the promise that he may be found guilty once they collect more evidence to “prove” it was him.  What is wrong with this country?!"
1986,"I find this very disturbing. Is it possible for Mr. Williams to press charges for having had to go through what must have been a traumatic experience for not only for Mr. Williams but for his family, too!???"
1987,"It's really a shame that no matter how much work we, as black people, do to ensure equal rights and justice, that there always seems to be something else lurking around the corner to steal our freedom. So now we have to worry about whether enjoying our lives and sharing photos on social media, like the rest of society, will mean that poorly calibrated AI computer systems + shoddy police work= us being arrested for crimes we didn't commit. Robert was lucky, but think of the damage that's been done, or will be done in the future to innocent people. We're so TIRED."
1988,"I listen daily to the Daily - I do rely on the Daily to get accurate news!  But the prevalence of “vocal fry” is extremely distracting when listening to the outstanding material.  Delivery is very important.  I hope that my comment won’t be taken the wrong way - just try not to turn the end of every sentence into a low growl, please."
1989,"I really enjoy this podcast, but listening to a conversation between two young ladies with severe vocal fry is making me pull my hair out."
1990,"Racism is when you assume a black person knows ""the drill"" while being arrested for a crime they didn't commit. It's irresponsible police work, to not even have tried to put up other evidence."
1991,"Why not place a camera in every room of Mr. Larsen's home?
Why would he object?  That way he'll always feel secure in his bubble of privilege and wealth amid the poverty and hopelessness of the Bay Area.  Oh, you say he already has a camera in every room?  Then he should put his security feed online so anyone can help monitor smash and grabs at his home.

I lived in SF for over 40 years.  I lived in North Beach, Nob Hill and the inner Sunset.  Never had a break-in or had to call 911 to report a property crime.  But when tech executives started buying up homes near by, petty crimes and break-ins moved in too.  For a seemingly bright guy rich from the tech bubble, Larsen doesn't make the connection between crime and the distance between rich and poor juxtaposed in SF's 49 square miles.

Old money in SF, mostly made from colonizing Hawaii, used to confine itself to Pacific Heights and its mansions.  Then the nouveau riche techies invaded and corrupted every neighborhood, even buying up five or six homes on a street to create mini-gated estates.  Petty criminals aren't dumb: like Willie Sutton, they rob places where the money is.

I have no idea how many homes Larsen has -- in addition to his doomsday bunker in New Zealand -- but maybe he should just sell his SF home and move to a more isolated, and safer, location.  It's not like he has no other options.

As old lefties and poseurs like Boudin like to say: property is theft.  In SF you don't need cameras to see that."
1992,"""1984"" is here and Big Brother is watching you so be careful what you do and what you say.  
When I die I hope I can look down and watch what is happening to this ol' world.  I don't think it will be a good thing to see.
I just feel sorry for the people who will be here to watch the demise of homo sapien.  Between pandemics, wars, and people like traitor trump it's sure to happen."
1993,"I think this guys's a real hero. He is helping residents live a more peaceful life like every ELECTED dolt in that city should be calling for. 

The city concil, famous for ignoring so many basics of urban life, should learn a lesson from him and maybe give him an award."
1994,"No police, just privately funded cameras- what a dystopia!"
1995,"Well, something needs to be done on the car break-ins in San Francisco. The tourists and residents are getting fed up and give a horrible image of one of the most beautiful cities in the world."
1996,That work so well in Baltimore!  Residents felt occupied and resented it.
1997,Why not create four million dollars of payroll for people who resort to stealing? Weren’t people like him called job makers?
1998,"The first time someone accesses the footage claiming to be looking for evidence of a crime, but is really checking up on a straying spouse in a divorce case...oh boy is that going to be an expensive lawsuit!

As for ""no expectation of privacy in public"" well yes people have always been able to see you.  Record on a massive scale in that level of detail and share with a potentially infinite number of people who have nothing to do with you?  It's not just a difference in scale, it becomes a whole new kind of thing. Kind of like how we're expected to consider a stockpile of AR-15's the equivalent of a colonist's musket."
1999,We need innovation to deal with these problems and the private sector has consistently lead on innovation.  Let's not ask this guy to fix all of the Bay Areas problems.  He might be on to something and we would all benefit if this succeeds in stopping certain types of crime.
2000,"No thanks !

So Mr  Larsen wants to fund a bunch of neighbourhood watchers create surveillance. Who tracks what is done to the recording. Who tracks who has access. 

What if one of these ""independent"" neighbourhood watchers decide that they wanna add facial recognition. What if another private company pays them to access this feed? 

SF law prohibits facial recognition to be used by the police so building a network like this could circumvent that law. 

This is actually worse than the police maintaining the CC tv system.  At least then we can have a singular entity responsible and accountable."
2001,"A lot of people seemed to be worried about a loss of ""privacy."" Since when did anyone have an expectation of privacy when they were outside their home?"
2002,God forbid the uber rich guy put those millions of dollars to alleviating real suffering. I’d like to see him sleep in a tent on the sidewalk and not be tempted to grab some rich guy’s easily replaced property
2003,"Good luck with this, but it is creepy."
2004,"""His father-in-law’s car was robbed.""

No, that's auto burglary.  Robbery is a crime against a person."
2005,"@kalmdown Actually that is no longer true. The technology keeps improving exponentially - practically every month, as PCs used to do. So no noise and no falling. They can stay in the air for hours on end - in the exact same GPS position, down to the centimeter. Think beat cops, except a drone can replace about 4 at once. Battery drainage? Swap one for a new 4 hour shift. And, think: No more tragic police chases. The drone identifies an individual and can track them almost anywhere."
2006,"I'm amazed how most commenters appear to resent what's taking place in this article.

There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public, which is why citizens are allowed to tape the police in the first place.

Living in crime ridden neighborhoods like this is dangerous and stressful.

Most commenters appear not to have noticed that it is the communities in which these cameras are placed that make the decisions about what is released, not the rich guy footing the bill.

God forbid people use technology to make their neighborhoods safer."
2007,"Mask and baseball cap or hoody or hoodie. 
Anyways, if society was more equal (ie if the rich didn't steal from the poor all the time, subtly) there would be less levelling-out of possessions."
2008,"What a ridiculous waste of money. That $4 million could have been invested in the Homeless Outreach Team, drug treatment, free MUNI for youth, job skills training, affordable housing, or any number of poverty reducing programs. As Mr. Larsen noted, surveillance doesn't reduce crime, it relocates it to other neighborhoods. We need to invest in programs that actually make a difference, not tech toys that only offer the illusion of security and don't create any meaningful change to the cycle of poverty in our city."
2009,"the police do nothing.  they are on pause.  You can shoplift up to 1000 with no arrest or anything. Homeless come here cause ""they can do anything they want"". We the residents are sick and tired of it. my life is like living in a 3rd world nation.  
Why is this happening because we passed  prop 47 reducing drug crimes to misdealers (50-60% of the homeless are drug addicts) AND we elected a DA who promotes ""RESTORATIVE JUSTICE'. (with no bail and letting criminals out of prison for what everyone says is a small crime. 

Then we had the black lives matter protists which made the police go on pause. They do nothing
 All of the people who can get out are getting out.
I am too old and I love this city.  it is a travesty. I think this camera thing could help if we had a functional government which we do not."
2010,This is a sick invasion of privacy. We need to be able to be in the world and not be recorded. Property crime has its roots in social problems that are complex and cannot be solved by surveillance and loss of privacy.
2011,"It's only a matter of time before the use of surveillance cameras will result in the stalking, sexual assault and/or death of an individual. Anonymous cyber stalking in other applications has proven so. Anonymous voyeurism in the real world will also show this to be the case.

Any surveillance through cameras, government or private,  demonstrates the greatest of intrusions into an individual's privacy. Being in a public space should not mean that anyone can be tracked and traced in real time, instances of which are known to occur in Baltimore and in London. Being glanced at by  passersby is in no way equivalent to what surveillance camera technology has implemented. We need laws forbidding surveillance camera usage in so-called public space.

Those advocating surveillance camera usage by only the state must be oblivious not only to what BLM has shown us about police practices but indeed to the notion of the police state itself."
2012,"I was in China working 20 years. Before people don’t follow rules as they can never get caught. Everyone jaywalked, spit, fought violently in the street over whatever... breakin, purse snatches and kidnapping were common. Police had given up and ignored most of it as no hope to stop it. Now with cameras everywhere and great facial recognition software linked to ones social credit system no one dares do anything bad, not even a jaywalker anymore. Why? Because people can use the WeChat app to chat with friends or buy anything if their credit scores is low. Nor can they get on a fast train or plane. Thus, people changed behaviour as there was instant financial and personal punishment given for every crime. You would get the ticket immediately via the app. I’d give up some privacy to have such system here. Cameras don’t do much if there is no punishment and they just wear a face mask, which because of the virus is acceptable to do these days."
2013,"San Francisco -- where I lived for a decade -- is now Brazil for tech Bros, where a moneyed elite Wonder why it is people who can't get by on their salaries break into cars, become homeless, contribute to street crime. Until San Francisco does something about housing prices and pay levels in the tech industry, it will continue to be a terrarium preserved for the wealthy while humans of less means are consigned to deprivation, illness, and despair. You don't have to record every single thing that happens in a neighborhood if people can afford to pay their rent feed their families and have a little left at the end of the day."
2014,"I should like to add to my previous comment:
Drones do not have to constantly fly throughout each neighborhood 24x7, nor fly over every street corner creating an overhead Big Brother scenario for pedestrians or degrading the look of buildings with unsightly cameras. (C'mon San Francisco, don't destroy the beauty of your neighborhoods)! Rather, drones could generate data as to the frequency of crimes on a particular street or area. They could also identify the frequency of escape routes to particular buildings or locations. None of this would require facial recognition but it would identify the frequency and recurrence of crime patterns, which could then be used for increased monitoring by designated individuals in the community."
2015,"I believe the money would be better spent on drone technology. The camera resolution is equal to (or better than) fixed cameras and GPS tracking could identify and record the escape routes of law breakers. In addition, outside of patrolling, 3D modeling of the buildings in each community would become possible and, thereby, afford disadvantaged youth the opportunity to learn new skills and a means toward income. Self-esteem just might replace anger generated by ""stop and frisk,"" to foreseeing one's contribution to one's community. Let's weigh the cost - monetarily and psychologically- of incarceration versus the cost of a drone and training our youth to benefit from them."
2016,"The pictures of these faces look completely real. The fact that a computer can actually create a fake face that looks real is crazy.  I was convinced they were someone until I was told otherwise. I think it is very dangerous to have these kinds of things because you will never know what is real or fake.Simulated people are starting to show up on the internet by business selling the pictures. There are even websites that make them talk. In the A.I. system, I notice blurry backgrounds, earrings on a single ear, and identical ear shapes. I wonder how the businesses that sell the pictures realize the mistakes. Some of them look like people I’ve seen before, but at the same time they don’t look familiar. They could be people I’ve seen on social media however, I’m not sure. After reading the spoiler, I see that they’re fake. I did not suspect that as they looked very real."
2017,"The pictures of these faces look completely real. The fact that a computer can actually create a fake face that looks real is crazy. I don’t recognize anybody out of these pictures, but they look like the pictures you would find if someone gave you their business card. I’m curious as to what else technology can do in this world."
2018,"The pictures looks very real, I was convinced they were someone untell I was told otherwise. I think it is very dangerous to have these kinds of things because you will never know what is real or fake."
2019,"Simulated people are starting to show up on the internet by business selling the pictures. There are even websites that make them talk. In the A.I. system, I notice blurry backgrounds, earrings on a single ear, and identical ear shapes. I wonder how the businesses that sell the pictures realize the mistakes. GAN generates images but also detects if an image is real or fake. It might be able to write handwritten messages in the future. The algorithms sometimes don’t always match the person due to the appearance change. Baggy eyes were flawed as they didn’t show. A repeated mistake was small noses, they all looked alike. The article warns how easily people are tricked, which I agree with. I definitely have trusted a machine more than myself."
2020,I believe these people do look real and may be a little too real of people. At first glance I had no clue these people were not real and did believe they were real when I first saw them. From their facial expressions every little detail on their face everything looks real. Although they do not like somebody I would actually know they do look like somebody I would see or pass in the streets or when I am out somewhere. I believe I have seen people like these on social media before as maybe catfish or scammers. I don’t believe it is a good idea for people to make these. It is more open for people to use themselves as catfish which is never good.
2021,"The pictures do look very real in my opinion. Some of them look like people I’ve seen before, but at the same time they don’t look familiar. They could be people I’ve seen on social media however, I’m not sure. After reading the spoiler, I see that they’re fake. I did not suspect that as they looked very real."
2022,"These figures definitely look real to me, upon first glance I definitely would take it as a real person, with a life. Some of them look as if I've seen them before in my life but, we see millions of faces in one year of our life so it's rather hard to tell if you've actually seen someone who looks like that or if your mind is playing tricks on you."
2023,"When I first saw the pictures, I thought they looked like real people. But once you look closer, you can see the colors throughout the picture don’t match and the face shapes don’t match on each side of the face. I also noticed all the backgrounds are blurry. If i were to quickly scroll through, I probably wouldn’t notice everything wrong with the photos and realize they’re fake. I think creating fake pictures and profiles will become popular in the future so people could steal your information. People can use these fake photos to catfish people act like you. We need to be more careful of what we do on our phones and what information we put into sites because one day someone could hack you."
2024,"On first glance, they all seem to be extremely lifelike, but if you look closer you can notice things such as colors that don't quite mix in, odd face posture, or the oddly photogenic nature of everyone in the pictures. As said though, on first glance this is terrifyingly realistic  due to the sheer ability of computers being able to craft such lifelike proportions onto a plain, fooling even the most complicated of human minds. It truly makes you wonder just what else computers have the ability to do."
2025,"The article warns that if we listen too much to these applications and systems, we can risk failure. I agree as many people are too quick to believe everything that a computer spits out at them, as shown in all the uneducated people you see in everyday life. There have been a few times where I have trusted a machine more than myself. Sometimes I will get onto Google Docs or something similar and the word corrections are just wrong. The application will also sometimes deny the existence of a word, and I change the word to the application’s suggestion out of doubt. Nowadays, I also double-check that I’m right before ignoring or making a change."
2026,"The pictures do look realistic, as they also resemble people that I see on a day-to-day basis. One change to someones photo can change someone's whole perspective. It's spooky to think that people believe these are real people."
2027,"These faces look very realistic to me. They do resemble people that I would see on a day-to-day basis. As I read on in the article, I noticed that the faces of the people either widen as age is added on, or have a different glow to them when put at a different perspective. This shows me that the result of one little alteration can change the whole image. The scary thing is most people believe that these are real photos of real people, not just altered pictures from a computer. This can lead to many people being fooled on the internet and believing something that should not be trusted."
2028,"yes the pictures look super real to me. They look realistic because they don’t look perfect or famous. They look like regular people we would spot at the grocery store. I could also see these people on social media selling something or maybe in ads.
questions: These people are starting to show up on the internet by a very simple app called “the perfect person doesn’t exi.” I have also noticed that in every single photo on the article, they all have the same types of ears. Also, they all have the same photo type. Generic advertising is just to promote things. Some flaws they tried to show but didn’t work was the dark baggy eyes. Some mistakes they have repeated were the small noses on each person. The warnings on this article are not very good because it just shows how easily the human mind can be fooled. I definitely have gotten tricked before. I’m sure this technology can be very helpful. Yet, we always have got to be thinking that they are smarter than us and to never trust the source."
2029,"If I was scrolling through social media and seen one of these faces, I would think it was a real person. If I look closer at it, I start to notice something is a bit off. The first thing I noticed was how they don't get the ears identical, one is either bigger than the other, or one is higher than the other. I also noticed they use blurry backgrounds for a lot of their photos, there is not one that is clear. If I were just quickly scrolling through I would not even notice this, because I'm not looking to see if its fake or not. I think it will become very big in the future, because a lot of people want to steal your information, but what if they steal your whole identity. I think we should be more careful about what we do on our phone and all that, because someone can steal anyone's identity."
2030,"They definitely resemble a face you could see scrolling through Facebook or some sort of social media. The thing is, the one thing AI just doesn’t seem to have perfected is teeth, or they just won’t have eyelashes and could also have a weird smaller detail, but these are all things that aren’t really too easy to spot just scrolling through. These people show up around the internet by companies buying them usually. I think I notice how weird the ears are, and how some of their teeth are a bit funky. I still wonder how it can look so real and create such accurate hair and skin. I think companies will mass buy these people and make their places look much more diverse. Also is used for gaming and could be used for even more in the future. Examples like how eyelashes may look weird, or something on the face is structured weirdly will show us how AI just isn’t perfect. One big mistake from the AI is how ears and teeth do not look natural. Also could have random artifacts that are out of place. I never really trust machines cause I personally own a pc and know-how dangerous AI truly is. AI is definitely more helpful than dangerous and could automate dangerous and hard jobs and do them very well."
2031,"I couldn't really focus on the game/'spot the fake' aspect of this article. This is a dystopian by-product of our advances, showing us how technology can diminish us and our humanity."
2032,"At first glance, I couldn’t even tell they were fake, but once I knew they were, I started noticing tiny flaws. First of all, all these faces are taken at the same angle, and I can’t tell you, one person, I know that would take a picture like that. Also, all the backgrounds are too vague/blurry, and all of their faces are in high definition. After I saw these flaws, I couldn’t unsee them, and I think it should stay that way.
      By that, I mean we should keep the software as it is but include tiny little mistakes so we know who’s real and who isn’t, as this technology could do some damage in the wrong hands. One of the advantages of having this kind of technology is that we could lure out catfish or predators who take advantage of this software and use it against them. On the other hand, it could also serve as a template to fake an identity and make it easier to conceal one’s identity. 
     Finally, I think this fake-person software is just creepy. It’s just realistic enough to be unnerving, but there’s just something off about it that adds to the on-edge feeling it exudes."
2033,"Problems with the facial recognition algorithms, include random objects in the photo, inaccurate and blurred backgrounds, and symmetrical features on a face. In one picture, there were random flowers in a girl's hair, and in another the guys eyes were the exact same distance from the nose."
2034,"As silly as it may seem, I believe that these fake people are going to start running stock photo companies out of business.  Now people will no longer need to get a generic stock photo from shutterstock because they will be able to purchase a unique one from an AI.  Plus, these websites are only going to become better at their jobs.  Which will only make it harder to spot fakes.  This will help catfishers, scammers, and identity thieves  take advantage of people,"
2035,"It appears that some faculty want the requirement that they produce cutting edge research (the core of a research university) reduced, and their bad teaching evaluations ignored (the essential for any type of university), but still to be given tenure, something that other knowledge workers outside off a university never get. All because they're ""moms"" (and like to show this off by bringing their crying kids to class). And some people wonder why parents can be seen as self-entitled by the child-free..."
2036,The misogyny in these comments is absolutely rabid. It’s the last editorially acceptable prejudice.
2037,"Another article that uses selective exaggerated examples as part of the ongoing PC effort to frame the pandemic as a female problem at universities, and to go on from there to suggest that universities should make jobs easier for women than for men, and that the employer should also reach into families and marriages to fix family problems that women can't address on their own.  If you think your husband isn't doing enough at home, would it not be reasonable to have a conversation with him instead of expecting your employer to ""fix it"" for you?  
The main caregiver problem is not being female, it's having small children now out of school or out of day care.  Male parents are doing extra duty on that issue as well.  And suggesting lower standards and less work just for being female, while having the same faculty job, is nuts.  Is there any common sense left?  Flexibility from employers is important and always welcome, especially during a pandemic when additional temporary flexibility is needed in some cases.  But can we work for that flexibility without the relentless drive to continually establish ever-greater exaggerated female victimhood...?"
2038,"And the fathers?  Oh, wait, the courts generally pushed them away but for the support check.  Good tactic; bad strategy.  Still stuck in the 1950's."
2039,"This pervasive lie is very popular, in the NY Times and other media:

The virus disproportionately affects people ""of color.""

It's nonsense. The virus doesn't care about skin color!

Economics is the root cause of many disparities, including this one. It's not about skin color!"
2040,Most universities have reduced their requirements for promotion and tenure for both research and teaching faculties. Some institutes like mine have hired more than two dozen new full time faculty (in a single college) during this pandemic. How these new faculty are going to be fully productive (while getting their hefty salaries) in a pandemic environment is anyone's guess. Attention needs to be paid to the staff and the non-tenure track teaching faculty (who have been ignored before and during the pandemic).
2041,"""waiving all nonessential service, such as serving on committees and administrative duties; suspending standards for research productivity; and giving teaching relief to faculty with the heaviest caretaking loads.""

These are some ideas for helping tenure-track female faculty members who have underage children. As anybody in academia will readily tell you, ""nonessential service"" is often a redundant phrase so I don't think it would be difficult to gather support for an initiative like that. 

But suspending standards for research productivity? I see implementation of that leading to some negative and potentially nasty consequences a few years down the road. Does anybody, male or female or white or nonwhite, wish to be perceived as having gained tenure because standards for research productivity were suspended at the time of the faculty member's application?"
2042,"Your timely article about the plight of female faculty on the tenure clock during today's difficult pandemic asks the wrong question: ""Will Universities Help?"" This question is too general and can be misleading.

Throughout my 18 years of handling multiple tenure cases, both within and across different fields of study in several universities, one administrative reality was always crystal clear: a professor's promotion and tenure fundamentally depend on senior faculty members who have achieved the highest rank in American academia. These influential tenured faculty members are the ones who give the final promotion recommendation to their respective executive officers--in hierarchical order: department heads, college deans, provosts, chancellors, and presidents.

So, the real question is: will the current tenured professors step up to the plate and help make a convincing case for additional university support for their vulnerable junior colleagues who are directly experiencing the negative impacts of the pandemic?"
2043,"I believe that the concerns by women in this article about their careers in academia are the same as those of men.  The pandemic has stalled millions of people of all shapes and sizes as far as career advancement.  Those hit the hardest are those on the brink of movement upwards - those 34-40.  Not saying other ages are not impacted, but young people are paid less making them appealing, and older people have experience and, hopefully, some savings after peaking in their careers before the pandemic.

So, ""will universities help?""  How can they, with minimal incoming revenues, existing tenured expenditures, and the fact that grants that carry PhDs are pretty much drying up?"
2044,"A day without a ""disproportionate effect on women and POC"" article is like a day without sunshine."
2045,"It's worth mentioning that academics on the tenure track are a privileged caste in universities. If you want to see the real carnage--suffered, again here, largely by women--look at the contingent faculty who just get fired outright in this situation."
2046,"The article is about mothers. 
Not all female faculty are mothers. 
Nor is ""caregiving"" always synonymous with parenting. Some people care for elders or others. 
I worry that the burden of providing support for mothers will fall on women, and perhaps others, who are not parents.  Institutions help mothers. They do not help people whose research is blocked by travel restrictions, and whose families are thousands of miles away behind closed borders. I am tired of mothers (and fathers) asking others to do their work for them so they can have extra income (and especially benefits), less service work, and longer tenure clocks."
2047,"They are lucky to have the option.  There are many non-tenure track professors teaching college full-time at universities, many female, who make half the salary with the stress of teaching four or more courses from freshmen to graduate school.

At least if they get the tenure-track assistant professorship, they are making 100K (in the NYC area) vs. 50K for the non-tenure-track professors who teach full-time.  Did I mention that the administrative employees are paid more - an office manager at a college often makes 60K plus...Or how about, childcare in this area is easily 10K per year per child.  

The reality in life with chlidren it that it is easier with a partner, and even easier if one partner has a flexible schedule.  The question I have is, what about female professors who do not have partners or children?  Are they lumped in with male professors (childless or not)?

This harkens back to ""do the single chlidless workers have to take the burden from the married with children workers?""  My answer is ""no"" - they should either offer the same to ALL workers, including payouts for time not used, or cut down on ""work-family balance for the parents"".  It is not fair."
2048,"This discussion is unfolding as if the challenge of having women in academia, or in any demanding field, only exists in the US.  What makes the US distinctive is the lack of any sort of organized childcare system peopled by well-paid employees.  The evident misogyny in many of the comments makes it clear why this is so."
2049,"Life is about choices. You actively make the choice to pursue a demanding career and you actively choose to have children (except in cases of rape, but even then abortion is readily available). 

Sorry, you and your spouse can't, and probably shouldn't, both have demanding professions AND have children. It's impossible. Who is going to take care of the kids? Child care / nannies are great but kids need to see and interact with their parents. One spouse should take an easier job with no more than 30-35 hours of work a week; the other can take a hard charging role."
2050,"As a tenured biomedical research faculty at an R1 university, I’m finding the COVID crisis a godsend because I no long have to constantly travel! Conferences, seminars, government grant review, and industry consults are all given over video instead. My children are grown now, but the requirement for constant travel was particularly difficult when they were small (I’m a woman). So there are some good things from this disaster.  
Hopefully when this crisis is past, academics will be able to agree that some of the onerous traditions of our job can be modernized to be less time consuming and wasteful of resources."
2051,"This article, understandably, focuses on the impact on female caregivers pursuing academic careers; we also need to be aware that this struggle is shared by nearly everyone. Academia was designed for a time when a *man* could focus exclusively on *his* academic career while his wife took care of everything else. The long hours, the moves from an undergraduate institution, to a graduate institution, to the first post-doc, to the second post-doc, to the faculty position, then visits to long summer programs and visiting scholar programs, and then sabbaticals in some far off place all interspersed with constant travel to meetings and conferences... presumably that was fun when there was a wife in tow with no career ambitions of her own making sure everything worked smoothly. That time is gone and academia has not bothered to change many of its traditions which now make an academic career a miserable experience for many who pursue it. COVID is exposing the cracks in the system. Academics are now of any gender and often have highly ambitious partners who are also managing their own careers. The system must continue to change to allow for flexibility and a reasonable work-life balance. Globally, our society needs to do the same. We deserve better and easier lives than the ones we lead now. Working yourself to death and giving up on trying to raise a family in order to fulfill the expectations of an exploitative system is not acceptable. We need to stop this."

2053,"Being a man and being a caregiver aren't mutually exclusive. Perhaps these professors should look in the mirror and look to their spouses before expecting their employer to bail them out. Choices have consequences. 

This is yet another case where the NYT isn't as progressive as it thinks it is."
2054,"The stymying or lost female faculty in academia harms not only those women and their families, but also and importantly, the students — especially but not only the female students (currently more than 1/2 of college students) — who will be stripped of role models and mentors in addition to the fruits of those faculty members’ brilliant minds."
2055,"At the small elite private college where my wife, who is Latina and the first member of her family to graduate college, has just recently gained tenure after 7 grueling years. In her school, like many, younger faculty skew towards women and non-whites. Their seniors tend to be, well, the opposite; now, everyone know what everyone gets paid already, by policy, so she already knows many of these old dudes make way more than double her salary, due to seniority. A lot of them also have invested in real estate here in Claremont over the years — once feasible on a prof’s pay, now impossible — and have become wealthy from that. Fast forward to 2020 and covid. School’s in financial trouble, so across the board pay cuts are announced, with a scale that says the more you make, the bigger the cut. So far so good. My wife and her peers are at the bottom, they take the smallest cut. The admins and guys who should be retired are at the top and take the highest cut. 

Yay. But here’s the problem: the school is also suspending its matching payments into faculty IRAs. This means that the younger you are, the longer you have ahead of you to work — unlike admins and guys about to retire — the more you are punished, exponentially over time. If you have, like my wife, 25 years ahead of you it adds up to a massive number. She and her peers, mostly young women and many of color, are subsidizing the college with their future while the admins pat themselves on the back for being progressive."
2056,"Here's a different point of view --

I'm a thirty-something white male - some would call me a strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of normal people. 

I can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel with his bare hands, and who, disguised as [Name Withheld] -  mild mannered professor for a great academic university, fights the never ending battle for Truth, Justice and the progressive, liberal, woke way. 

In spite of the fact that my time is consumed with tasks such as saving people from submerged cars and repelling invading aliens from outer space - I still find time to help my wife, Lois - a science writer and research assistant - with household chores and child care -

We both do our bit to help keep our family safe and healthy during this very stressful time -

It's not that difficult - If I can do it - so can you ..."
2057,"The general idea of fairness, in retention policy, is valid. However, the examples of discrimination in the article, are a dog's breakfast-- and no gift to any real 'research'. Most alarming are the warnings that the pandemic will cause ""loss of female power"" on campuses (as if one female employee = one automatic vote on an issue); and references to ""anecdotal reports"" and ""Twitter outcries.""  
In fact, anecdotal reports and Twitter are generally the enemy of feminism. The reference to student evaluations is gossipy as it now stands; were the complaints of ""tone and dress"" of the instructor verbal comments, or were they on a grid of mathematical score? And what was the mathematical weight of those negativities? And how did the males being evaluated compare during this period? And if there's real gender discrimination inherent in an evaluation form, who said the college can't simply change the evaluation form?"
2058,You know what an obstacle to research and building a career looks like? Hiring panels that say “it has to be a woman.” Minimally accomplished female graduate students being hired over field-leading male postdocs with books already published. Male candidates being asked questions like “how would you talk to female students?” Or being told they’re too “muscular”. Quotas for diversity hires when the market is already at its limit. All these are obstacles to a research career. On the tenure track already? Cry me a river. The academy has bent over backwards to hire you.

2060,"We appear to be on the way to racial quotas for awards, school acceptances and likely much more -- particularly, jobs of all varieties.
This should have the effect of exacerbating conflict, which will likely lead to much more racial violence and even greater segregation.
And I'm on the left."
2061,A lot of anger over food!!!
2062,"My problem with fine dining in recent years, particularly in cities like NY or Miami, is that it's essentially just a form of corporate welfare. If you took the expense account-paid meals out of the mix, many of them would have fallen onto hard times long before the pandemic. It's not fair to let such indulgences be written off. If rich people want to pay out of their own pocket, wonderful. But not at the expense of dodging taxes."
2063,"The new normal will encourage more people to cook for themselves. Elite restaurants have long been vanity businesses - the type of business that is risky but personally fulfilling to the chef. After many years as a grower and vendor of specialty produce, I became repulsed by the preciousness and pretension of many chefs, some of whom were James Beard winners. Even though most kitchens comped me a take away dinner upon delivery, the restaurants I patronized were modest mom and pop ethnic businesses. The food was better and I was not irritated by a faux art form rather than sustenance. The future of dining will be home cooking and take out meals and no one will die of deprivation if they are denied an amuse bouche. The James Beard awards are as dead as James Beard."
2064,This seems unfair to those who won. Why shouldn’t they at least be told they won.
2065,"Although there have been questions raised about the Beard awards over the last decades and at least one very public financial scandal, James Beard hailed from Oregon where he celebrated American and Northwest food.  We are proud of him.  He was quite a character who taught wonderful cooking classes out at the beach in Gearhart, Oregon. I still go to several of his recipes, time and time again.

However, I do feel badly for the finalists this year who have had the awards delayed not once, but twice.  The Beard Foundation should just give out the awards virtually and be done with 2020. This year is always going to have an asterix next to it.  After the awards, THEN pause everything and re-examine what is important.

Unfortunately, the ""Foundation"" appears to have become as bloated and overweight by indulging itself as its namesake did."
2066,"""outstanding American chefs"" -- Are there truly any such?
Looking at the list of James Beard Awards, I had a very low opinion of the Foundation's culinary tastes."
2067,"Quite frankly I think The NY Times Cooking section needs to diversify its staff.  I like a lot of writers, but I can’t understand why there aren’t more chefs from diverse backgrounds expanding our palettes.  For example, when Melissa Clark or Alison Roman passes off a traditional Asian dish or curry as some newly invented stew.  Is this really necessary for the readers of The Times to feel comfortable cooking a dish that might seem a smidge foreign or exotic?  I also don’t see many chefs of color (or any really) in the cooking blog.  It would also be infinitely more interesting to learn about food origins and stories from people of different backgrounds.  I suspect the same goes for other chefs from institutions. It’s really bizarre to me given the culinary talents that can be found everywhere, like seriously my Persian neighbors probably could write a poetic, sumptuous posting about celebratory foods they cook every year that would blow the readers of Times away. It’s not hard to find.  NYT Cooking, please diversify your staff and introduce some new voices."
2068,"Disappointing.  They couldn't give thought to recognizing the blossoming creativity notwithstanding these trying times.  Isn't that what cooking is all about? Maybe that's it, JBF awards culinary art and not cooking. And like a museum, this art is apparently shut down.  Not sure what kind of kitchen credit JBF will have when it resurfaces."
2069,"Who cares? The James Beard Awards may have meant something at one time, but not for a quite awhile."
2070,"While it is unfortunate that the awards cannot go on for now, I am relieved it is not because of some transgression that had recently been discovered about James Beard. That sort of thing has been happening all too often lately."
2071,"Can the NYT please ask the question, in a story that follows the money all the now unemployed/underemployed chefs,  their restaurants and staffs raised to support the James Beard Foundation and its ""House"" on West 12th: What is that money doing now?
This morning, on the JBF Web site, the staff list shows four people with job descriptions labeled ""chief,"" four as ""vice president"" and some two dozen additional employees listed as director/manager/coordinator - close to three dozen supervisory jobs funded by now-job-insecure folks who staged decades of dinners and events to benefit JBF. Did so because they believed in the foundation's mission. Understandably wanted the awards program to continue.  
Clearly JBF faced a conundrum about the awards; sponsors for that event, which necessarily had to be rescheduled, re-imagined, likely were an issue. Also an issue is diversity at Beard; so JBF is commissioning a study/audit of itself.
While JBF pauses from its House dinners, its awards, its big-ticket fund-raisers and in-person events, accountability to all who volunteered for JBF these last 30+ years is critical - for one, to assure all that those monies raised aren't now paying for 30+ supervisory JBF jobs. No one wants to see more job loss in this industry. But the industry's own frontline workers do not need to suffer more injustice. 
Not releasing award-winners' names as JBF touts its transparency surely is another issue for discussion. But shine a light on the money now."
2072,"I haven't eaten in a restaurant since March but when I do get the chance, I enjoy meals at one of Ashley Christensen's several restaurants in Raleigh, North Carolina. She is a former James Beard Foundation winner and deservedly so.  She makes ""real food"".  Ashley Christensen’s James Beard Award elevated Raleigh as culinary destination in May 2019.  Through the years, I have eaten at several of Ashley Christensen’s restaurants in Raleigh, North Carolina and have enjoyed many excellent meals.  While some of her eateries are too trendy for me, her food is first-rate.
Christensen was America’s top chef, and that meant everything in 2019.  Winning the award — considered the food universe’s mountaintop — is no longer just about what’s on the plate or menu. It’s a measure of impact and influence.  She won the James Beard for Best Chef: Southeast in 2014.
I don’t care much about awards but the James Beard Foundation award is a big deal I’ve been told.  I want a clean restaurant that is not pretentious with really good food and good service at affordable prices."
2073,Maybe people 2500 Miles from a Michelin rated restaurant don't understand how these awards drive chefs to seek perfection.
2074,"I look forward to the demise of the typically loudmouthed, over-praised, and downright annoying celebrity chef, although I expect that it will take decades if it ever happens, given the power of the overall Celebrity-Industrial Complex.

They could've retooled the ceremony to give a Most Respectful of Covid Regulations Award, but I'd understand if there were few nominees.  At least a few have seemed proud to NOT even bother to be For Your Consideration in that category."

2078,Very bold choice to throw up your hands and just walk away.
2079,"I'm still getting take out form my favorite restaurants once or twice a month (all I can afford). 

I wonder, tho, what will become of the best Chinese restaurant in my small city. It's a local landmark, filled with amazing Chinese art and carvings... and it's a buffet. They have been closed since spring. 

In that sort of market, perhaps rather than cancelling the Beard Award, it ought to be awarded to all the restaurants managing to eke out enough money to stay open."
2080,"During all of this pandemic mess, I have had zero interest in going to a restaurant.  Can't think of one on the planet that I have to visit.  Making the same food at home has been great.

Instead, I'm more interested in who's grandmother/grandfather/mom/dad/sister/brother/aunt/uncle/friend makes the best pie, tamales, BBQ, pasta, pho, dumplings, etc."
2081,"I suspect that the  world will neither notice nor mourn the loss of the James Beard Awards, the same being true for Michelin and their stars.  Perhaps it's time to re-examine the culinary awards as well as the concept of chef as celebrity - - it's all become irrelevant."
2082,"Heaven help us is if the people who write comments in the Times ever get to decide who’s funny and who isn’t. By all means, do whatever you can to ensure that everyone gets a fair shot at the spotlight or the writers room or the open mike, but keep your hands off the comedy. There are comedians I’ve never liked and material I have found offensive but I would never think of suggesting that they couldn’t do what they’re doing no matter how much I dislike them. Only people who have run out of ideas (or never had any in the first place) resort to shutting others down. If you don’t like what they’re putting out there, write your own sketches. If the people on stage don’t look or sound or think like you, do what you need to do to get up there and show us how it’s done. If that doesn’t work, form your own troupe or support one that makes the kind of comedy you want to see. If it’s funny the audience will let you know. You can count on it."
2083,"Geez...this is becoming tiresome.  Everyone has to strive and struggle .....and most of us face obstacles or people with prejudices toward our ""group"" which we may be assigned to w/o even being aware that another sees us as 'the other'.  Check out Second City's website....there has been a long standing director of inclusion and diversity....and she is female & African American.
Sorry, the BLM'ers are going to make most of us start to retort that All Lives Matter.  At some point every ONE of us is discriminated against...."
2084,As someone who produces comedy I won’t have woke “comedians” (their sharp blanket condemnations are a huge flag) anywhere near me or my crew. Amateur and emerging artists are sensitive and skittish and don’t deserve to be bullied or have their speech or material policed. ??
2085,"I’m a longtime improviser who regularly is on stage with a theater company in SF who happens to be Caucasian.  
Most of the comments are missing the point. You want a diverse cast not to be politically correct but to be more inclusive, realistic, and funnier.  Diversity makes the whole cast and you stronger. The stories you make up and tell will be so much better and relatable to more people.  With that your theater company will be more successful as you will draw a larger audience. 
      It also goes deeper than just putting POC on stage.  You have to let them tell their stories.    There is no greater honor than when someone trusts you enough to let you tell their story on live stage.
      Finally, to those commenters who say “I hope they’re not just promoting people who don’t deserve it” I say get over your talent judging. There are so many qualified POC, woman, LGBTQ, etc...who can just step right up and deserve it.  What they don’t deserve is being pigeon holed into a demanding stereotype."
2086,"It seems that, sometimes, people create their own angst out of whole cloth."
2087,"This is what happens when you FORCE DIVERSITY in art. What's the difference between saying ""This comedy troupe is too white"" and ""This music group is too white."" Were the Beatles and Rolling Stones racist because there wasn't a black guy in their bands?  I understand that Second City is a bigger company and school, and it's great to encourage people from all backgrounds to get into comedy-- but that doesn't mean we have to discourage like-minded (and similar looking) people from forming their own groups and troupes. If 6 Jewish guys want to form a comedy troupe, they shouldn't be shamed by the race police for ""whiteness."" Anybody who views ""whiteness"" as an inherently bad thing is part of the problem."
2088,"The irony of this is that the funniest comics who ever lived were or are  black.  Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Leslie Jones, Tyler Perry (sorry but Madea is insanely funny), the Wayans brothers.  I could go on.  Nothing like oppression to create humor.   So why is  SNL  still so depressingly white.  Why are there no blacks or females hosting late night talk shows?  I hope to see a 50% black cast on SNL sometime soon."
2089,"The irony of the posts on this article is that the ""white guys"" who are claiming that everyone should just take the jokes, are the very same who can't take the joke when it's about them--the fragility of white masculinity."
2090,"My introduction to performing comedy came through classes at the Second City Training Center in Chicago. Two elements of the instruction I greatly appreciated were in paying attention to power dynamics, i.e. with rare exceptions, not using our comedy to ""punch down,"" and to break free of gender/race tropes in our characters. It's limited, uninteresting comedy when women's roles are defined only as a wife or mom, and when racial minorities only play the convenience store clerk or taxi driver.

In an imaginative format like improv, we were taught there should be more nuanced, zany, and offbeat characters, and we saw that translate to a funnier product on stage. My classmates were diverse by race, gender, age, and sexuality. For whatever success that represented, though, we were only beginners/amateurs, and at same time, the ""Red Line"" mainstage show was experiencing its controversies with bigoted audience members and cast conflicts...

Humor is subjective. What some folks find pleasantly recognizable, others find stale; incisive satire for some may be insensitive to the rest. And because comedy is an art form that often pushes boundaries, a perfect balance is impossible. But we're better off when there are more voices from more backgrounds in comedy, and so I wish Second City the best of luck with their latest reforms."
2091,Is it possible that different cultures like different types of comedy?
2092,"I'm gobsmacked at the most ""recommended"" posts here. It seems the majority are saying, ""Woke culture ruins comedy"" and ""Get over it"". Man, these last few years have shown who we really are as a country."
2093,Great. Let's be as inclusive as possible. But please do not foist untalented people on the public for the sake of inclusion.
2094,"Sure - because after all - who doesn't like their comedy - woke; non-confrontational; and PC.

These guys need to re-watch some Dave Chappelle - their heads might explode and he was an equal opportunity comedian."
2095,"As if playing a role isn't ""filling a box."""
2096,"Well, at least Second City pays its performers, unlike the Downtrodden Comedians Volunteer Theatre, which is an equal-opportunity exploiter."
2097,"Close the survey appeal at screen edge please, thanks."
2098,"Define Whiteness. Is it the Russian-American delicatessen two blocks away from me? The Armenian-American church across the street? The Argentinian-American restaurant I used to like to at before Covid-19? Mostly white Coachella and Burning Man? Smith College? My friend's military intelligence unit, 75% white? Rural Appalachia?  Iowa? The NHL, to Blackness' NBA? Hasidic Jews? Amish people? Candace Owens? Shelby Steele? Larry Elder? John McWhorter? What a foolish term. In the 1960s I understand radicals used the term ""whitey."" Go back to that, because at least we know where the user is coming from."
2099,"Continue to identify as a victim....and you'll always be a victim.  Underneath it all, it certainly appears that a culture that doesn't want to become mainstream is complaining that they are treated as different.

Go figure."
2100,"So why doesn’t Oprah (who better?) step up and buy her home town Second City Organization (chump change) and bring her unparalleled cultural leadership and the full weight of her communications empire to bear on making Second City the funniest, most culturally diverse and enlightened home for artistic expression in the world? Now there is a challenge for Ms. Winfrey, and what an ego booster if she succeeds.  Now that would be real leadership for this great cultural institution now in need."
2101,"Now you need to do an in-depth article on the Dave Chapelle Show re black and white stereotypes being portrayed.  Would the black comedians on SCTV have an issue doing a simile portrayal on the DCS?  By the way, I love both shows and am only referring to the sketch content and not behaviors toward the comedians themselves."
2102,"The author is complaining that Second City is ""too white"" based on some weak anecdotes, but I bet he has nothing but love for Astronomy Club (Netflix), FCC (Dallas), The Black Version (Los Angeles), Blackout Improv, all of which are comedy troupes where whites are explicitly banned from membership."
2103,"Describing Second City as being founded by ""three white men"" is a smack in the face of Paul Sills, Bernie Sahlins and Howard Alk - all pioneers in the artform. Compass was the first professional improv cabaret in North America. Describing Campass as ""a university of Chicago student group"" diminishes that accomplishment."
2104,"Folks bemoaning cancel culture and the death of comedy, here's my experience. About ten years ago I attended UCB.  An improv sketch was a one trick racist joke about Jefferson owning a slave (in which we were led to think it was a dog).  The mostly white audience laughed, but my friend (person of color) and I (same) looked at one another unsmilingly. I even saw two young laughing white women in the audience give each other five. Yeah, didn't go back--the humor I saw that night was clearly not created for me."
2105,"Sometimes all caps is needed so they hear ""HEY, SECOND CITY, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?""  Get on it, now.  Thank you."
2106,"""One day, Kelly Leonard — then a theatrical producer, now the executive director of learning and applied improvisation at Second City — came into Callier’s office after receiving a positive financial report on the center. “He said, ‘Hey, how does it feel to have my white feet on your Black shoulders?’” Callier recalled, suggesting that he was benefiting from her work. She was aghast. “It felt like slow motion,” she said, “like, Is this happening?”

Still there. Still receiving a paycheck. Time to go. Time for us to speak up.  Joyce Sloane would agree.  Miss her. ""This is not the Post Office!""

So true.  Talent matters.  And should be color blind."
2107,"At one point, FoxNew bailed from Twitter and YouTube, didn't they?"
2108,"If YouTube is pushing Faux News, they are not cutting down on misinformation."
2109,"I cancelled ""cable TV"" years ago. Consequently, I don't receive FOX News! I use a TV antenna and have a fast ISP. As far as algorithms, the use of them is ubiquitous. Besides YouTube,other massive offenders I have found are Google, Netflix and Amazon. In spite of this, YouTube is the only social media website I have ever used (for a simple reason): Occasionally, I find interviews with people or stories on subjects I am fascinated by. For example, they are an excellent source to watch monologues by political comedians. People like Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers and Keith Olbermann (longtime fan!). His ""Olbermann vs: Trump"" pieces are superb. Unfortunately, I have to weed out garbage like ""How Stanley Kubrick Faked the Moon Landings for NASA"", and other trash of that ilk. I take the good with the bad. Such is life!"
2110,"FOX is and long has been synonymous with with mis/dis-information in the form of  """"entertainment.""""  Alphabet is trying to take the lead."
2111,"What's the difference between ""Misinformation"" and Fox News? I don't get it."
2112,"Fox, not a reliable news source, likes to gin up anger and hate against their fellow citizens by spewing half truths. There used to be a YouTube video listing about 50 Fox News lies, but after a bit of searching it seems to no longer be available."
2113,"Social media sites are not designed to promote truths. The algorithms are pushing the popular, trending content to rack up the most advertising revenue they can. The information coming from these sites are not what you expect, the information is a indicator on what people believe and/or are entertained by. If a news story interests you, dig deeper into it. Look at the local news in that region and ignore the big news organizations. The big boys cut the original story into pieces and focus on one part that benefits the beliefs of their viewers. It's an amplified feedback loop. These media groups hope you keep your guard down so they can manipulate your view and to keep you coming back. They don't care about the truth, they care about the money. Finding the truth is your responsibility and that will involve talking to people on the other side of the argument."
2114,Dang it. I don’t watch Fox anything so I guess I have stop supporting YouTube too?
2115,Just introduce internet police. No algorithm will solve disinformation as long as that video exist on the YouTube site. People should be held accountable for the fake or disinformation they post. Put them in jail or fine them.
2116,"It is such a joy that innovations spawned by America’s best and brightest are divesting significant numbers of the viewers of social media of their critical thinking skills. No wonder Russia and China have recognized the dangers to their regimes and have firewalled their countries from the threat to allow their homegrown brainwashing algorithms equal time.

And speaking of time, it is well beyond time that government regulations put social media back into its pandora's box. A world without Facebook and Twitter would be a much better world."
2117,"I cannot understand why anyone would get their news from social media in any form, when it is obvious that the algorithms are essentially designed to promote what seems popular (rumors, conspiracy theories, etc.) rather than what is true."
2118,"Money speaks, as usual. But, if Social Media is trying to cut misinformation, how come Fox Noise is so prominent on their platform?"
2119,"If the best the right can do is Fox News, they need a stronger journalistic voice with a higher level of integrity. Don’t get me wrong, it is like shooting fish in a barrel to find examples of liberal bias on MSNBC and CNN, but the extent to which Fox is willing to spread questionable or outright false stories is unparalleled. 

Never once have I seen CNN or MSNBC spread conspiracy theories or false information like Fox News. In fact, what the network considers “news” seems to consist of angry, highly opinionated talking heads and clickbait. 

When can we stop pretending bias is “just as bad on both sides” and see Fox News for what it is: a problematic assault on truth and trust in news reporting?"
2120,"This article is troubling to me in many ways, implying that truth is easy to identify. I stopped my overconfidence in the news outlets mentioned as reliable after the Iraq war. Bad Covid reporting too. Since when has being the CDC’s stenographer been a good idea? Oh and just this week it was reported that the WHO is not the bastion of virtue it was previously portrayed as. No one saw that coming, as if!"
2121,"Some Democrats are still in shock at Carlson's clear, sharp words about venture capitalism and the emply factories it leaves across America.

He is so honest about the people meaning harm to American families that he has been the TOP-rated program across the country, not just among news channels."
2122,"Fox News should be shut down. Its denial of pandemic science, like efficacy of face masks, and its denial of the science of global warming, is dangerous and deadly. There is no First Amendment right to yell in a crowded movie theater, ""There's no fire!"" when in fact the building is burning down."
2123,"""YouTube Cut Down Misinformation. Then It Boosted Fox News.""

Sounds like a oxymoron, or contradiction in terms to me, given the vast amount of misinformation on Fox"
2124,"Fox News is as bad as QAnon, maybe worse because it pretends to be “fair and balanced.” One Fox News watcher expressed surprise to learn that 230,000 people have died of Covid. Fox News highlights science deniers, both deniers of the efficacy of masks and the fact of global warming. The last thing we need is more people in that fact-free, anti-Democrat silo that has made it impossible to compromise and fix problems. 

We need a new Fairness Doctrine for broadcast and cable news like Fox so instead of being instilled with one party’s propaganda, people can make educated decisions. Hope it’s on Joe Biden’s agenda, otherwise Fox News is an abyss between us."
2125,Tucker Carlson is good entertainment.  THAT is why the video in which he features has been recommended so many times.
2126,"Well, which is it? Did they cut down on misinformation or did they promote Fox News? It can't be both."
2127,"All YouTube did is to centralize the disinformation, centering the for-profit propagandists. Shameful."
2128,Fox is the center-right analogue to MSNBC.
2129,"YouTube wants you to stay on their platform as long as possible, so of course the algorithm will send people to more outrageous sites. The real solution to the propaganda problem is for YouTube to stop recommending videos, especially news videos. It is outrageous that Google and YouTube have this kind of power without being actually elected by people."
2130,"How was Fox News designated an ""authoritative source?"" Fox News has defended itself in court with the claim that it's entertainment, not news. Are these videos identified as misleading?

This is a prime example of Trump supporters working the refs."
2131,I am shocked to witness that the same liberals who deplore GOP's lies and misinformation are avid Youtubers and supporters of Google -- one of the most dysfunctional and predatory organizations.  It must be broken up!
2132,"Nowadays knowing what is fake and what is real is important, fake news isn't just lies, fake news is lies that obscure the truth and cause disinformation, so teaching children and teens how to distinguish such lies from the truth is something that should indeed be thought in school.
Many people think that they can spot a lie if they heard one, so they say that having media literacy in school would be a waste of time, but that could not be further away from the truth. In an experiment where people were asked to judge statements as truth or lies, they judged correctly 54% of the time, which is just a little higher than the percentage they would get if they're just blindly guessing, some rare individuals can achieve a score of 80% or higher in the same test, individuals with this peculiar sense of lie detection are called truth wizard, but in a group of 15,000 people, only 47 have been classified as truth wizards, so as you can imagine most people won't be soo lucky to have this rare trait."
2133,"Nothing you see on the internet is real, all is fake, and you shouldn't believe any of it; this is all a simulation, and we are being tricked. Did you believe that too? Well, not all of it is fake, it's just dramatized; see, it's that easy to make something exaggerated and make text intense. So the first rule is don't believe all you see, but sometimes you have to trust the internet, and when you do, use logic and external research, please. 
	I had fallen for some minor misinformation when I trusted the media and news sources way too much; despite this, I never spread fake news during this time. The only times I've spread fake news that was not minor is when I am playing around, which is later explained. Typically people think that it's the end of trusting in the internet, but it's just based on where you look; most people can find out if something is fake or not with enough thought put into it. Even if the news can't be judged right or not with analysis, then research small websites that do not get much media attention that speak the truth.
	I am an individual that does not share many articles and serious politically correct content but instead uses social media as an entertainment platform. Using social media for fun prevents me from spreading fake news and lets me focus on factual information elsewhere."
2134,"I think we must have medical literacy. The future tends to be more technological and a person who cannot use the internet for his good or help. I think it is essential, and yes, it must be a course given by the school. It is clear that that does require less time and fewer activities than a class or a regular period. The future will be highly technological, and for sure, you will need to use the internet and consult it several times a day, so the better you know how to use it in your favor, the better. If your school does not allow you to take this course, do it online, for sure in the future, they will want or even require media literacy. Many people might think that this course would be unnecessary and learn all of that more quickly. However, I believe that society needs to be educated on how to use the internet. There is so much to learn. We need to remember that cyberbullying is something huge that starts with the misuse of the media and the internet."
2135,"For a short and direct answer. Yes. In the world that we live in today, for one to thrive, one has to know well. And for that to happen, precise information is needed. As well as false information can be harmless, it can also be dangerous. To make sure only the right information is shared or viewed, schools should hold discussions on how to identify fake information, or everybody should often question themselves on why something should be true or false."
2136,"One of the reasons why the internet is so convenient is that it quickly disseminates information, and everyone can be a publisher. As a result, people fight to recognize what is real and what is false. The network facilitates the spread of 'fake news', as shown in a study published by the journal Science, which points out that untrue information spreads six times faster than accurate information on Twitter.
	I agree that schools should educate students on media literacy and how to distinguish reliable from unreliable information. However, I cannot entirely agree that it should be an entire course. Perhaps, it would be more convenient as a subject topic, in classes like English or Advisory."
2137,"In a race against time to contain the spread of a deadly disease, fake news constantly overshadow scientific data, generating, in addition to a health pandemic, a treacherous information crisis. We live in an age when all manners of scientific knowledge - from global warming to vaccination - face furious opposition, and social media is the primary tool responsible for disseminating these ideas. Due to conflicts with personal beliefs, deeply ingrained views, and strong emotional appeal, false information gains more strength to change public opinion. Moreover, we hold a selection bias and tend to look for evidence to support a hypothesis, neglecting the evidence to the contrary, consequently empowering conspiracy theories. For instance, the flat earth movement has been rapidly increasing in popularity since 2014. So has the conviction that climate change is a hoax, with only 35% of Americans considering global warming to be a severe problem, 9% less than in April last year, according to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. Therefore, it’s essential to incorporate media literacy classes, educating young people on how to correctly read and interpret news online, distinguishing what is factual from opinion. Nowadays, with unreliable health information circulating the internet during a global pandemic, this might be the skill separating life from death."
2138,"""Do you think the spread of misinformation is a problem?"" Yes. I think that misinformation is a huge problem because if you spread fake news, many people will believe that it is true. This could affect the person because if someone posted a fake news saying that you cannot travel to Europe because Brazil is having a lot of cases of covid-19. If the person thinks it is true and he/she has a schedule to travel to Europe for work, and he/she cancel his/her airplane passage because of a joke. So I think that this needs to stop because this could affect a lot of lives."
2139,"In a world where people are pursuing power and success, communication is the number one weapon to thrive. Therefore, I believe Media literacy is vital and exerts significant importance in students' academic lives. Yes, schools should implement an effective media literacy program to help students analyze the vast amount of information from different questionable sources and wisely opt for their news media channels. Besides, it is fundamental to this generation to learn from past mistakes and be educated to avoid political propaganda, fake news,  cyberbullying, and fraudulent advertising. We all know we can become prey in the hands of articulated influencers and news media. Therefore, we must develop strong media literacy to avoid the traps in the digital age."
2140,"Information controls our world; that's why media plays a significant role in our society. Therefore, schools need to teach how to identify fake news and the power of information; people need to understand that today media can destroy lives and control people; false news influences our society so that we can't even realize that we are being manipulated. Consequently, classes about this massive world of media are essential for our civilization. If the next generations learn how to use the internet and news vehicles correctly, many issues in our society would be solved.
 Many people might think that this course would be unnecessary and learn all of that more quickly. However, when I think about a system that teaches students how to deal with media and the internet, there is so much content, we can't forget that cyberbullying is an issue that comes from the misuse of the internet, and that's just one example, imagine how many problems can be solved with this course."
2141,"Every day we are bombarded with information about our city, country, and even the world, but a question remains to what extent are they real? Our generation's tendency is that the curiosity and eagerness to learn take control of us more than ever.  One example is to compare how we are different from previous times, where what wealthy and powerful men said was the truth. We have been taught to question, search, and speculate, and transform the new generation into the powerful ones, the ones who walk aside the truth. The newspaper, radio, and tv are some of the most popular ways of spreading information. Still, contrary to what others may think, the media does have the power to persuade our thoughts and shape our ideas, turning them into dangerous weapons if not used properly. As the article has mentioned, it is impressive how with only the click of a bottom, fake news can be spread and gain more power than ever. It is inevitable for counterfeit information to exist, and our intention is not to extinguish it because we never could but is to teach people how to deal with it. Media literacy has proven through this article that goes beyond just knowing if an article or a post is fake or not; it gives you perspective on how to examine information. I believe it is a critical ability, and as we are talking about the future leaders of the world, it wouldn't bring any harm to them an additional skill."
2142,"Media Literacy. In my opinion, it is crucial to know how to identify fake news and identify reliable sources. Fake news is hazardous and has many consequences, so before you spread it, be sure it is accurate. One example from the text is, “Kim Jong Un is personally killing soldiers who have Covid-19!” before spreading such things, it is essential to know it is real or fake news.  So, yes, I gather schools should require teaching media literacy to benefit students and society."
2143,"The spread of fake information is one of the most substantial problems with social media and the internet in general. Still, the root cause of this problem is deeper and more complex than commonly assumed. The problem isn't just about the democratization of information. It is neither some range of individuals producing waves of disinformation. Those are all consequences of several digitals platforms that are misaligned with our best interest as a society. 

The real concern is that if we as a society don't have a shared reality, where we can act upon a set of facts, democracy doesn't work. Moreover, let's face the truth, this isn't about a child's problem. As we can tell, by 2019, a third of online users worldwide were aged between 25 and 34 years. 

Although I think it affects both adults and children, I'm aware that children are more vulnerable and more affected by this problem.

Nevertheless, there are still ways to help young children from using social media or exponentially decrease their screen time. Moreover, this is important because if we want to have our children nurtured with real information, there is a need to get far from those platforms for some time and see the whole situation at a higher level. By observing the case at a higher level, it would be easier to stay away from the entire turbulence and universal concern feelings."
2144,"I have never fallen into a trap, but people have already sent me several false news. Most of the time, they send me some info; I search different sites to see if it is true or false; not to pass on incorrect information and possibly cause some conflict is familiar or with a group of friends. When younger, I may have sent a fake news story to a friend or my parents. I think it may have some consequences, and they may be terrible, causing the expansion of this fake news, causing protests, etc. And I think some of the fake news doesn't cause many consequences, just some discussions on the fake news topic."
2145,"Humans have created amazing things throughout history, the wheel, the plane, the car, but one of the most amazing human creations was the internet. The internet is a fantastic invention. It's a whole world, an online world, and like the real world, there are always threats, and we need to be aware of them, and the internet is the same thing. There are thieves and kidnapers in the real world; hackers and bad people will want to take advantage of your innocence on the internet. Since I was a little kid, my mother always taught me that I have to be aware of what can happen on the internet and avoid these problems, but I was lucky to learn this at home; most people don't. That's why schools should teach how to use the internet with caution. In the world that we live in now, everyone uses the internet every minute of every day. We need to know how to navigate this online world in the safest way possible."
2146,"I agree that media literacy should be taught in school. Our generation has access to media, technology, the internet, and many others, which makes us easy targets for fake news. We need to learn over the long haul that we can't trust all that we see on the web. With the web, kids are significantly more defenseless to be affected by things they see because of the broad data introduced that may consistently not be valid. They are barraged and deceive with realities through instant messages, images, viral recordings, online media, computer games, promoting, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.
Additionally, they are influenced by not secure data; but rather likewise presented to different sorts of harassing that can be hurtful to their future. Media education is the capacity to recognize various kinds of media and comprehend the messages they're sending. These days, it's essential to show kids since early on media proficiency because most don't have the foggiest idea of perceiving the contrast between a precise new and phony one. It will make the perusers or watchers see the media unbiasedly, to discover or examine what is being introduced, not being impacted by assessments or untruths spread over the web."
2147,"social media is very dangerous in many ways, one of theme are the impacts that they have with all the people manipulating them, showing things that they don't need and make people want to have it. midia alsow shows you fake news and many people fall in it and she it to many people and it started spending lick a disie, but there are also many good things in it for example that people can learn more by researching in many different sites, people can express them selves, have a lot of fun by playing a lot of games online, meet new people I'm social midias, and they can even make a lot of people change their opinions"
2148,"Navigating the waters of various media sources has become quite challenging.  Without guidance, it can be very misleading. There have actually been quite a few times where I’ve innocently fallen for satirical or fake news.  I vividly remember that for quite some time, I actually believed the statements from a certain news article. Not being aware that it was satire news, I believed the statement that dogs lick our faces because they know we have bones in our bodies and they want to eat our bones. Luckily, this so-called-fact never went past my father and I. After sharing it with him one night, he encouraged me to check the site because he believed the story absurd. And, sure enough, it was satire. I felt so embarrassed! 

It is important to realize credible sources such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the New York Times compared to Wisconsin’s The Onion. A young lay person would not know which one is credible initially, but over time and with experience, this would become more apparent. Wouldn’t early education of such media sources be invaluable?

This one example sets the tone for why education about media sources would be very helpful in order to not fall prey for fake information which is playful, but also information which can be very prejudicial and harmful. While this example is harmless, statements about people and organizations can be misleading, hurtful and slanderous.  Disarming such information by promoting media literacy through education is the key."
2149,I believe they should teach this because my generation believes in everything they see on the media.
2150,"I believe that it should be taught in schools because, in my opinion, my generation believes too much in what they see online, and worse than that, they are spreading this information. The Internet is a powerful tool and something essential for our world today. People need to learn how to read something and not assume that it is true; they need to search for creditable and not biased fonts. It's always good to look for a second opinion. I think that this is so important for everyone's lives because, like other people, I already fell for clickbait videos on youtube, and classes like Media literacy can teach us how to avoid these type of situation"
2151,I think media literacy shouldn't be taught in class because not everyone needs it.
2152,"I have personally seen misinformation being spread around on social media multiple times. Usually the misinformation isn’t anything major but if it was, then the fact that that information is being spread could have consequences. Most of the fake news and whatnot I encounter is pretty easy to discern when it’s fake, but there are definitely things I’ve believed and encountered that I believed were true. The skill of media literacy is just becoming more essential each and every day as our society becomes more digital, and information becomes easier and faster to spread every day. The author talks about ways to incorporate it in school, “Even without legislation, teachers can incorporate media literacy concepts into existing classes or offer electives.” The idea of incorporating media literacy into lessons seems like a better idea to me because I don’t feel that media literacy would need an entire class to teach. I personally have had media literacy taught to me within lessons in school and they taught me the basics effectively. I think that as false information becomes more prevalent the only way to combat it is with knowing how to distinguish it as false. The best way to do that would be having media literacy taught to some extent in schools."
2153,"I don't usually get myself involved in media and news, but I think it's super important to learn what's going on in the world. Some of today's media outlets have been bent to conform to a specific dominant political ideology. Both ideologies have been manipulated in which they use fake news to destroy the conflicting ideology. With this said, I believe that Media Literacy should not be taught in school. I think it is important, but it should not be taught in school because it can force an idea on a child. When we enforce ideas on children it hinders their free thought and they aren't as open to new ideas. I either think parents should teach their children, or they should try and figure out what they believe on their own."
2154,"I do not believe that media literacy should be a required course in school because it doesn't seem to be something that it would take a full course to learn. While media literacy does seem to be an important skill to have we are already taught about source credibility in classes like english so we should be able to tell if the source is credible or not and even if we are unsure research can be done on the media in question to see if other credible sources have reported on it, and this skill can be applied to things like social media sources as well and unintentionally enhance a student media literacy. In the article it talks about how the kids at the school spread the misinformation about kim jong un rapidly without knowing it was not credible but I personally have never really seen such a large spread of misinformation as described within my school, aside from currently with the election where there doesn't seem to be much care for the credibility of information posted. Since we only really learn about source credibility when it comes to things like articles it could be a good idea to include a lesson on media literacy on social media platforms just to make sure that students fully understand, but not an entire course."
2155,"How subversive can language be.  In the 1980s - before the erasure of China’s Communist era honorifics from popular usage - the word ‘tongzhi’, commonly translated to English as comrade but having a more literal meaning suggesting a shared philosophical path, was the politically correct form of address. How clever it is that at some point along the way Gay people slyly coopted the levelling Communist Party terminology."
2156,Amazing article!
2157,"Reading stories like this makes me sad that humans have been around for over 100k years and >99.9% of that time was spent with extreme LGBTQ oppression.

Reminds me of Family Guy's Road to the Multiverse... imagine a universe where reality was not judged/oppressed."
2158,"This was really informative--I was surprised Chinese society/government was not more repressive. 

I do though wonder, along with others, where the lesbians are in China. Certainly not in this article."
2159,"Where are the lesbians?

Why are most of these articles regarding the L.G.B.T.Q. community always about gay men?  Lesbians face the same kind of scrutiny and discrimination that gay men face.

Never in my life, did I think I would still be fighting for the same things I was fighting for as a young lesbian.  While gay life in China is both modern in some ways and backwards in others, any gay person in America will recognize and appreciate their struggles.

It's more than 50 year since I fought for equal rights for lesbians and gay men.  It's 50 years since I attended and started some consciousness-raising groups.  And, it's 42 years since I helped organize a tribute to Harvey Milk in Los Angeles after his assassination.

We're still fighting for acceptance and equal rights.  We'll never stop.  To my fellow lesbians, make your voice heard and stand up for yourselves.  No one else is going to do it for you."
2160,"At last, a positive story to take my mind off all the awful men.

So far, so good for LGBT people in China.  I hope their success grows.  If the government would pay for surrogacy, they'd have a lot more wanted children."
2161,"Historical Chinese culture might not have condemned homosexuality, but gay men - especially the eldest son - were still expected to marry women so they'd produce (male) children to carry on the family name.  I'd guess it was similar to Greek (Roman?) culture."
2162,fang/shou (“opening up and tightening”). This explanation of the political status quo's relationship to the Queer community in China gave me a good chuckle for not very noble reasons.
2163,Can you please translate this to Chinese for some of my Chinese speaking friends?
2164,"I've been to China many times and have many friends there, and have traveled together with my husband too.  We've never felt the slightest bit awkward either among our friends or walking along the streets of various towns holding hands together.  The lack of a Judeo-Christian ethic is a blessing in disguise for Chinese gays.  True, the social stigma of having a family and children remain, but it's a societal issue that doesn't have anything to do with homosexuality, per se, but rather making an equal contribution to Chinese society as defined by basic family standards.  Having said this, the notion of family and children and so forth is also changing in China and it's only a matter of time before China joins Taiwan in legalizing same-sex marriages.  Cases have already made it to court and I believe they will be approved sooner rather than later."
2165,"I read the comments, and many have imprtant things to say.  But what is important here is that they can be said in the very first place in mainland China.  I understand the opinions of lesbians and transgendered people.  But this is a good safe quiet start.  After reading this one thing I thought about was all the very very brave gay chinese who are trying to make a better life for themselves, and others."
2166,"A fascinating article but, like many NYT articles about LGBTQ people, it is devoid of any discussion of the experiences of women and transgender people. How can an article about what is purportedly the biggest gay website in the world fail to quote or interview one Chinese woman or trans person about their coming out experiences with respect to Blued?"
2167,"Very interesting article, many older Chinese I know tend to deny the widespread existence of homosexuals in China and ascribe it to the shortcomings of Western morals. Yet another example of how remarkably conservative and backwards the Chinese Communist Party is with respect to anything having to do with sexuality. Not exactly revolutionary. 

By the way, ""tongzhi"" isn't ""the Chinese word for homosexual,"" that would be ""tongxinglian."" But as ""comrade"" fell out of favor over the past 30 years, the homosexual community adopted it as a euphemism for referring to their own. The use of ""tongxinglian"" would risk censorship, ""tongzhi"" of course would not."
2168,"Terrific article. I also think Liu's description of the tension b/t activism and change-by-the-rules is both real and not a real tension at all for a simple reason: There's no choice. This is reality. And change by the rules that allows for ever increasing growth, for the quiet growth of tens of millions of openly gay people and hundreds of millions of straight people who are friends with and family of openly gay people is, in any case, the only real thing that makes real change. All there is is just coming out. That's all there ever was or will be. Just coming out. On we go."
2169,"This “feature” appears to me – a Hong Kong gay man with a reasonable exposure to the general happenings in the mainland – to be a picture penned somewhat behind rosy glasses. To put things gently.
First thing first, calling Jin Xing “the nationally beloved talk-show host sometimes called China’s Oprah” is utterly ridiculous. The lady’d be the first one to agree. From what I know of her. She doesn’t even have her talk-show. Or any influence to talk about. At best, she is the guest of a reality-show.
Jin Xing became the TOLERATED token transgender woman in China before Xi’s reign. She was lucky. 
To say that “in contrast to other minority groups, the LGBTQ minority poses no explicit threat to party value and is low-priority to be on the government’s radar” is presuming the party values military threats above ideological threats. Which is not the case of the current regime. Xi, for the past few years, has been working hard on his legacy, tearing pages off Mao’s little red book, tidying up loose ends to secure that he’d not be another Gorbachev – the guy who lost the Communist Party to the people. It was not a military lost.
Of course, how people work and play is not necessarily in accordance with the party’s wish. 
When it comes to play, Travel Guides do tend to stay away from any LGBTQ outlets on their China pages. Because they want to stay on good pages with the regime. Or else…they are not welcome. Like NYT."
2170,"In China everything seems to move in lightning speed, but cultural inertia is hard to move.  The acceptance of gays & lesbians in USA took decades. Americans are very ""religious"", most people grow up brainwashed by traditional Sunday schools. Still, the move towards modernity and turning the back on medieval religious dogma worked. 

Chinese can learn a thing or two from Americans in this case. How did they managed to finally make same-sex marriage legal, TV shows about gay characters, and a gay mayor running for American President? 

A couple of things could work for gays & lesbians in China, just as they work in USA: money, fame & success is one. If one is as successful as Apple's CEO Tim Cook, all is forgiven. The other is pledge of patriotism. Pete Buttigieg won a badge of honor for being a veteran, which has considerable currency in America's military & macho-culture. The same could work in China. Being an ex-cop or ex-PLA, or better yet, a CCP party member, could help to turn cultural tides."
2171,"This article claims to be reporting on “gay” culture in China, yet there is not one lesbian female quoted or mentioned by name. And the one transgender female mentioned holds male supremacist views. No matter the demographic—gay, straight, white, black, rich, poor— there seems to be a troubling propensity to assume that the males of that demographic are the default and that it’s acceptable to ignore the voices and intersectional concerns of the women of that demographic—in this case, lesbians."
2172,Does the paper have a Chinese owner now? This is the second front page story about Chinese culture in the NYT today. Seems unnecessary given the primary and the virus.
2173,"Marxist and Marxist-capitalist countries like Russia and China normally ban homosexuality. (Marxist capitalism is a system combining thought control with love of money). China's one-child policy led to a great surplus of young men, since baby girls were given away for adoption or aborted so that the family could try again and perhaps have a son. Because of the surplus of young males, Chinese rulers grudgingly modified their position on homosexuality, since too many single men might have led to a more rebellious society. Allowing gay men to follow their instincts would lower the number of men who could not find mates.
Unfortunately, this could not help the situation of Chinese lesbians."
2174,"What an extraordinarily thorough and well-researched article.
As someone with a gay friend in Shanghai, this echoes the challenges of his day-to-day experience, especially as he continues to live with his family. I learned a lot, and articles like this are why I continue to subscribe to NYT."
2175,"This well-written article was a reminder of the enormous progress we've experienced in the US in my lifetime, and of how far we have to go worldwide to overcome archaic beliefs. I was heartened to read about Duan's progress, and hope that our brothers in China take heart. It gets slowly better."
2176,"I am both hopeful and reserved about this article. Hopeful because it is nuanced and in-depth enough to provide a more complicated view of LGBTQ in China. Reserved because underneath the surface it still employs the same over-universalized substructure of identity that has defined the movement in the west. I hope that readers will lean into the paradoxical aspects presented, not as problems to be resolved, but differences which are unique to each place - proliferation without activism, culture and economy, acceptance vs. publicity. 

These uncomfortable differences are surely felt by many Chinese as well, but it is also important to note that:

1) in the most fashionable and trendy public spaces in Shanghai you can openly walk out in drag 

2) American companies such as Burger King can openly target LGBTQ customers in their base in a way that they never could in the US 

3) The Chinese streaming platforms such as Bilibili or Tiktok have become increasingly ambiguious spaces in which themes (such as beauty and cosmetics) are utilized for expression of sexuality in the guise of tutorials (by gay men, for example). 

The catastrophic situation for LGBTQ in China is for the community to become yet another pawn in the ideological battle between China and 'the West.' In this regard I think the western free media holds a great responsibility."
2177,"It should also be mentioned that the CCP is firmly committed to raising the birth rate as China ages precipitously because of the decades of one-child policy.  Anything that impacts marriage and child-bearing is given close scrutiny; same sex relationships fall into that category in China.  
As an example, the common modern vasectomy procedure (NS non-scalpel) was pioneered in Sichuan two decades ago.  Upon arrival in Chengdu hospital two years ago to request the procedure, I was told it was no longer offered in public hospitals. The urologist gave me the party line: it is against nature."
2178,"Engaging article on a topic that should receive more attention. Regarding terminology, I find the blithe substitution of ""queer"" for ""LGBTQ"" problematic. I understand that for those under 35 (or so) who were educated in the Global North or for those who now reside there, ""queer"" might be an acceptable catchall, but it is to me and to many highly limited in its applicability (i.e. age-, site-, and culture-specific), unlikely to be of use in advancing or extending human rights globally, and loaded with pejorative overtones. Yes, the shifting alphabet soup is clumsy, as well, but perhaps we could find consensus around UN nomenclature: LGBTI."
2179,"In 1991 or 2, Jonathan Kozol came to Albuquerque to give a talk about his new book, Savage Inequalities. Many of us public school teachers attended that night. Kozol's words stayed with me, and I continue to share what he pointed out that night: his research showed that despite ""equal funding,"" public schools in more affluent areas always had way more resources than public schools in less affluent areas. Kozol also talked about how parents move out of poorer school districts, or enroll their kids in private schools. Charter schools were not common yet in the early 90s. But the ""flight"" from neighborhood schools sure was common. Since hearing Kozol and reading that book, I have always kept the perspective of how unequal our public schools are, and how affluent white families can take away a school's success by moving away or sending kids elsewhere. So many of my friends did just that when I became a parent in 1994. We did send our daughter to the local public schools through middle school. She chose charter high school."
2180,"This whole idea is disgraceful. ‘Nice white parents’, as if that’s something to be ashamed of.

Stop with the white bashing. We whites were born with the skin we were born with and do the best we can."
2181,"In the early 1990’s I chose to open enroll my son at the downtown elementary school in our city, which was integrated and had a reputation for being progressive, although we lived in a suburban school district that was highly rated academically.  I don’t regret it and I am happy with the more creative if less academically rigorous education he received. 

As a “nice white parent,” I was active in the PTA. and spearheaded efforts to start an after school enrichment program and to organize a year end class trip for graduating fifth graders which benefited the whole school regardless of ethnicity.  I worked alongside other parents, who were mainly affluent and white.  I do not recall any minority parents, either black or Asian being involved in PTA.  

I think the role of parent’s educational level and economic status and their involvement in their children’s education is critical in understanding school success and unfortunately the author seems to have blinders on to see any causes for an achievement gap other than white parents like me."
2182,"I recommend to anyone ""THE EDUCATION OF MINORITY CHILDREN"" by Thomas Sowell. The epistemic closure of the authors and producers of Nice White Parents is evident in the book list, and evident in that fact that so many working class and minority families in NYC are fleeing the educrats' public schools for charter and parochial that will provide the order and resources needed for their children to flourish."
2183,"I'm really struck by one line in the first episode. It was a throwaway line about the tours that were meant to ""lure white parents into segregated schools"". White children attend segregated schools also. That is how segregation works. This is no small point about white supremacy. The problem is always located in the bodies of people of color and, more often than not, black people. Racism is a problem for people of color--only they experience it. So black children attend segregated schools and white children just attend schools."
2184,Rob did nothing wrong. His efforts to raise funds and organize parents had no victims at all.
2185,"I've just started listening to your podcast and have enjoyed the first episode, however I have a couple of comments about its accuracy in relation to the PTA.

I have been a PTA leader in California public schools for the past 13 years and I want to clarify the core of who and what the PTA is about. Many people including the listeners and participants of your podcast refer to the PTA as a fundraising organisation. The PTA is not, and has never been a ""fundraising"" organisation. It is an advocacy organisation and its role and aim is to be an advocate at a national, state and local level, to build and increase family engagement in school communities, advocating for all children to receive a fair and equitable education. It lobbies elected officials and influences legislation at all levels.
All PTAs rely on donations in whatever form to pay for core programs to support literacy, advocacy and the arts and, essentially everything that happens in the classroom. 
All PTAs have to abide by PTA By-laws and are restricted in how they use their operating budget. They cannot, for example, pay for teachers or employ anyone to run their programs, and they are bound to ensure that every child has the opportunity to benefit from those programs - that's why volunteers have always been so crucial.

It's really, really, important that your listeners understand the vital and very important role of the PTA to advocate for all our children and their right to access a good education."
2186,"I was quite surprised when this podcast was announced because it covers the same territory as the podcast and grassroots movement called Integrated Schools.  Now that I've listened to the NY Times podcast, the overlap is clear.  Even on the reading list, there are some of the same authors and topics that were already covered quite well by Integrated Schools.  This is such an important topic with a dearth of dedicated resources, why would you create further divide in the already limited resources?  Part of this discussion is about listening to the voices of those who are already doing the work- why not first check with the grassroots organization that is already doing the work of highlighting these topics, in a podcast format, and also doing something about it?"
2187,"The reading list is very lop-sided. What I see is a list of books that simply bolsters the podcast's a priori conclusions. Where are the books that discuss other, hard-to-acknowledge points of view? 

I'm thinking of doing a podcast called ""Fire Bad."" My reading list comprises of 6 books about the Great Chicago Fire and a bunch of medical books on caring for burn trauma victims."
2188,"It seems strange to that what's missing from this reading list is any accounts of going to IS 293 in the 70s-80s. In Episode 3, the podcast presents this time as ""normal"", nothing going on. However, there is a remarkably detailed account of a white boy attending IS 293 in the 1970s in Jonathan Lethem's The Fortress of Solitude. This account is fictional but, based on interviews  I've read, pretty close to the author's experience. Lethem's account suggest it was really difficult for him and he was subject to low-grade racial violence his entire time as one of the only white kids in the school.

I think discussing the description of IS 293 in The Fortress of Solitude in the podcast would provide context to the white parents' demand for a ""Gifted and Talented"" program at MS 51 in Episode 3. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 70s and 80s and remember the pervasive racial fears that white parents had about sending their kids to public schools, because they feared violence and chaos. Was this racist and privileged? Absolutely, but omitting Lethem's book and description suggest that the podcasters want a neat and tide story, and don't want to examine the complexities of racial conflict in NY."
2189,"""Did you think of yourselves as integrators?"" I would have rephrased the question: ""Did you realize you were colonizers?"""
2190,"I’m astonished by the majority of these comments....completely tone deaf. 
Moving your white kids into a struggling black and brown school? Great! But how about acknowledging an extremely obvious method of creating a new community together, Spanish as a second language?? It is spoken everywhere in the U.S, but very few white people even make the attempt to learn the language. Also a Romance language quite beautiful and extremely useful.
START THERE....then build on that."
2191,"There are differences.  Maybe you speak faster, not certain what you said? Can someone clear that up!  (is that confusion, misunderstanding, a complaint, and the person he is just trying to understand, what is said)
Very difficult for students to understand.  Let’s see if we can learn and write together.  We have copies of the New York Times. I have folded this paper to this article.  With your pencil l want you to trace Each letter. When all is finished.  All of us will read it at once!  When we finally some words may be misunderstood, i will attempt to pronounce them.  

That’s the first lesson. Later why we capitalize the first word,  then we make it into like a paragraph is.  We can continue ... but more than this I want to hear from you. Perhaps you can locate the words in the article similar to your word.  Maybe not accurate but then you are learning to practice or copying writing...  you bet...and learning today and with continued lessons tomorrow we will practice and learn..right here ..."
2192,Links in the article would be really helpful...
2193,"When a parent or anyone else can create a separate fund raising program for a school or direct what happens with the money, the district has a choice about whether to accept the money or not. School district leadership seems to be the ""culprit"" in the story here, not parents who are involved. How does the author propose incentivizing more parents to become involved in schools?

Anyone who has ever been involved in PTAs knows how clicky they sometimes are and how there can be infighting among school parents. There is also much to be gained from parents coming together. I would be wary of giving a PTA too much power. It's school leadership who should be running schools and who should be accountable.

The podcast authors put together an opinion piece and are entitled to their opinion.  They are right about Chicago closing schools that are low resourced. It's wrong."
2194,A group of 35 white parents collectively applied to a half empty school that was mostly black and brown.  Now the parents bring their skills and their money and try to fund the type of enrichment programs that bring more parents like them into the schools.  Next comes advanced classes for algebra and biology. Those classes may or may not ever be integrated - depends on each child’s ability.  You can have a school that is 50/50 but the actual classes won’t be mixed if the students abilities aren’t similar.  I don’t know how to fix that if the PTA can’t even work together on fundraising goals.
2195,"I recently finished reading Rachel Devlin's ""A Girl Stands at the Door."" It is an absorbing account of how young black women and girls as a group played a significant role in the desegregation of American schools during the mid 20th century. I think it would make a worthy addition to this list as the ""relationship between white parents and the public school down the block"" is at the heart of what those brave young women and girls fought against."
2196,"I listened to the first episode of this series. It is  excellent.
Every child deserves a community  and resources.
The parents raising money for the French immersion program were doing it for themselves, not the community. They say they want diversity but just in the right amount.
The book of statuses showed what the white kids were overhearing at home."
2197,"Life will always be comprised of competition between people for resources. The question becomes what kind of competition is fair and moral. In reality though, competition will never be completely fair. Those who have available resources have an advantage. Those who have knowledge have an advantage. Those who live in a good school district have an advantage. Those whose kids end up in the right teacher’s class have an advantage. Life is full of hundreds of advantages and impairments, of which race represents a small percentage. Understand that white parents are competing with other white parents as well. Doing our best to make sure all schools have the resources needed should certainly be a top priority, however this will not completely level the playing field."
2198,I think we should start this discussion after reading Jonathan Kozol's Savage Inequalities.  It was published almost thirty years ago and the truths it lays bare are still a major part of this country's reality.  The intentions of parents and educators are like a superstructure built on a very flawed foundation.  Kozol made it clear this was not an accident.
2199,"In the sixties my children attended integrated schools reflecting our community.  They had several Black friends.  When Black is beautiful became the slogan, the Black children became uncomfortable having white friends and stopped hanging out together.  Tables in the cafeteria at lunchtime were no longer mixed races as the Black children self segregated.  My children were confused and hurt by this.  That was in elementary school and it continued throughout high school.  Black children were discouraged by their peers from having anything to do with white classmates.  What began as racial pride, something positive, turned into something negative."
2200,"When white parents move into predominantly minority neighborhoods and schools, the times says that they should adapt to the local culture. But when minorities move into white areas, the times says that those areas should accommodate the newcomers. You can't have it both ways. If minorities have the right to maintain their cultures and practices when moving into white areas, then white people have the right to bring their culture with them into minority areas."
2201,"The core problem is that nothing we have done in the past half century has brought the average Black child’s academic performance close to that of the average white child.  That includes affluent suburbs such as Shaker Heights, where all students come from educated, middle+ class families.  In an effort to avoid the “same building, different rooms” situation, tracking has been reduced or eliminated.  All that really does is force high-functioning students to have their education slowed down to accommodate below grade level “peers”.  The “nice white parents” quite reasonably react by moving their kids to a school with fewer low performers dragging down classroom learning.  Statistically, that means finding a white/Asian majority school, but the core problem is academic competence and behavior, not race."
2202,"This article does a grave disservice by describing blushing as being entirely psychological and suggesting that it's the blusher's fault and within their entire control. I'm shocked that there is absolutely no mention of rosacea, nor of the genetic propensity for blushing/flushing that plagues, for example, those of us of Celtic descent. (Can I hear an ""Amen"" from my fellow Irish-Americans?) 

Traveling to countries like Ireland where this genetic propensity is widespread makes you realize how strong the genetic component is and how impossible it can be to avoid all facial blushing/flushing, even if you steer clear of triggers like alcohol. 

Trust me, not everyone whose face is flushed is embarrassed, drunk or menopausal -- although some of us may be all three at once!"
2203,"All the comments are helpful and the article unsusal.  I’d been an easy blusher all my life but developed rosacea after using a OTC hair loss medication that had niacin in it (Viviscal).  Avoiding alcohol, spicy food and hot drinks is key but if I feel an outbreak coming I immediately guzzle a LOT of water...like 2-3 glasses.  Sometimes, not always, that will completely diffuse a reaction.  Mirvaso as a topical is great but my condition really improved after a series of IPL (light) treatments.  When I see fellow blushers or rosacea sufferers I just want to hug them....we are turtles without a shell...and harder on ourselves than anyone else could ever be."
2204,I am a physician assistant who treats patients who blush every week. Most of those individuals have a skin condition called rosacea. Flushing and blushing from emotion or sometimes alcohol or spicy foods are the most common precipitants of this common aesthetic skin disorder. My point here is that many people who flush have this disorder of their skin and it is not a psychiatric disorder.
2205,"I read an article once about tightening your ab muscles in those  instances when you stand up too fast and start to feel faint.  Now when I feel like I'm starting to blush, I try the ab muscle tightening technique and it seems to help."
2206,"Hot flashes are the bane of my existence. I’m fair skinned and have red hair. When I get a a really hot flash for some reason, each cheek turns into a burning scarlet patch that stays on my face for the rest of the day as if permanent. The flip side to someone blushing is being able to tell if they’re angry or ashamed, depending on the circumstances. Large electric fans and the frozen food shelves at supermarkets are my friends. I’ve had hot flashes for so long I don’t remember when they started. I agree with the reader who said in reference to the hormonal hellfire, “oy!"
2207,"This article does a great disservice to severe blushers by focusing on psychological issues when medical issues are often the cause.    

For some people, excessive blushing isn't a psychological issue, it's the skin's overreaction to normal levels of anxiety, excitement, stress, heat, exertion, etc. 

A variety of medical issues can cause excessive blushing.  One of the most common: rosacea.  Experts estimate 16 million Americans live with rosacea, but only a small fraction get treatment.  

I developed rosacea in my 30s, starting with excessive blushing, which was totally out of proportion to the very minor stress, anxiety or excitement that I was feeling, and got so bad I literally blushed purple. 

Luckily, I was properly diagnosed.  I currently use 4 topical medications: Soolantra, a compounded Niacinamide cream, Noritate,  and a sulfur cream.  I'm very happy with how these medications have controlled my rosacea.  

I wish everyone struggling with rosacea could get the diagnosis they need.  A dermatologist visit is necessary for this problem, and patients may need to see more than 1 dermatologist to get a diagnosis.  For me: 1st doc said I didn't have rosacea; 2nd doc said I did have rosacea, but didn't help me get it under control; 3rd dermatologist got it right and no more blushing purple!

Please do a follow-up article on rosacea to provide more useful information to severe blushers.  See rosacea.org."
2208,"Starting around age 12 I started blushing very brightly, especially if embarrassed in the classroom. My charming, nasty classmates dubbed me, ""Beamer Boy"". Throughout the next few years my classmates would taunt/bully me relentlessly in the hopes of making me blush so that they could torment me even more with the Beamer Boy epithet. One day, I snapped and punched one of my tormentors in the face when he called me that name. And that was the end of Beamer Boy....."
2209,Sweet ending.
2210,"After reading all of these comments, and sharing so many of these issues that go along with blushing, I’m curious how many “blushers” also experience migraines. 

Thanks for this article."
2211,"Brace yourself for hot flashes, all you young blushers. Oy."
2212,I've been a blusher for years - it's horrible to suddenly turn red for no apparent reason when you're leading a meeting or in a random conversation. It's especially frustrating because I'm otherwise very comfortable in social situations and public speaking. I've noticed it's gotten worse since my diagnosis of young onset Parkinson's five years ago. Wonder if this condition may be another one of those noxious Parkinson's symptoms?
2213,"Thank you for writing this article!  I have never met anyone outside my family who had problems with uncontrollable blushing.  It is comforting to know I am not alone.  I am 56 and have been dealing with this my whole life. When I was younger, I would purposely get sunburned so I hide the fact that I didn't know why I would get so abnormally red.  When I would start to blush, someone would inevitably say ""why are you so red!"" or ""are you OK, you don't look good"" and then I would blush more.  It became a game to some people to see how red they could make my face get.  I never wore makeup because I couldn't figure out how to hide the redness without feeling like a clown.  Over the years, I have become more accepting of this problem which has helped in controlling some of the blushing. I started taking Lexapro in my early 40s, which seemed to make help in the severity of the blushing.  Maturity and overall acceptance for my flaws has helped, but I wish I would have been more comfortable in my own skin when I was younger.  One positive that has come out of this is that I do have a strong sense of empathy for other people struggling with social awkwardness.  When I see someone struggling, I try to do what I can to make them as comfortable as possible because I know how being called out about something you can't control is a terrible feeling."
2214,"As a chronic blusher and sufferer of rosacea, I was hoping you'd address any connections...."
2215,"I was plagued by blushing as a teenager and as a young adult.  I never received professional help.  Instead I would get sunburns so that I could deny blushing. 
Because of the sunburns, I have been plagued by skin cancers. I have had a number of skin grafts and radiation on my face.  My dermatologist downplayed the experience of blushing, saying that blushing wasn’t so bad.  I responded with - it would be just like wetting your pants in front of people.  It was torturous for me.  I had fellow students comment when I had to speak in front of a class.  It affected my social life as well as my early work life.  I recall reading an article about a young man who committed suicide.  His mother believed it was due to his social anxiety and blushing."
2216,I have always been a “strong” blusher and now have very “strong” menopausal hot flashes- is there a correlation? I bet yes.
2217,"As a pre-teen, I was a ""social"" blusher. I was teased in junior high school because even my arms blushed. But in high school, for a variety of reasons, my self-confidence grew and I somehow trained myself not to be surprised or bothered by crude jokes or distasteful subjects. I cannot explain exactly how I figured this out, but it was instinctive and it works. I don't remember being teased in high school or college. 

However, I am also allergic to some wines, and definitely beer, both which usually make my face bright red and hot. So I drink wine from Europe because it tends to have less sulfites and less alcohol. I seldom drink beer. These strategies usually work.

Recently I was diagnosed with rosacea, which this article did not explore. Not all blushers have rosacea, and I am not sure all those with rosacea blush. Medically speaking, it seems that doctors do not know biologically what causes rosacea, only what triggers it (wine, coffee, heat, bad air, etc.) and what drugs minimize symptoms. I may have had it all along, but very bad air from the California fires in October 2018 and 2019 triggered a burning rash and peeling on the checks of my face unlike anything I had experienced. I was amazed by the discomfort and frustrated by how it looked. A cream plus an antibiotic - both expensive even with Medicare - helped temper, not stop, outbreaks. 

Thanks for a great piece on the topic! We blushers appreciate it."
2218,"Paradoxical intention can work really well. When the blushing starts, intentionally try to make it continue. That reduces the anxiety and embarrassment, because once the blushing is  welcomed it's no longer a threat."
2219,Use finacea (brand name) or azelaic acid gel (generic) twice a day  on your cheeks and that will take care of it. The gel is expensive but it works.
2220,"This is the exact same reaction I have whenever I see a doctor for any reason. Known as ""white coat syndrome"", it causes my blood pressure to go up as high as 200/180, which, of course, causes them to want to send me to the ER in an ambulance. This has happened so many times in my 75 years that I'm surprised I haven't had a stroke during a routine physical exam. That, however, is my greatest fear.
 
I was an RN for 45 years and never had a problem with elevated blood pressures or blushing in my entire career. Now, that I need to see doctors more often, I have this problem every time. I am on meds for blood pressure, but I take my readings every other day and they are always normal at home. I am also allergic to beta blockers, having had an anaphylactic reaction to them. 

Frankly, I'm at the end of the proverbial rope. I avoid doctor visits as much as possible(fortunately I'm very healthy), however I do have the usual wellness checks now required for seniors, ie.,colonoscopies, mammograms, etc., ad nauseum. I can feel my pressure rise even when I'm being weighed by a medical assistant. All of this is after I've taken a xanax prior to the appointment. I hate sounding so negative but I honestly don't know what to do."
2221,"I suffered from this condition for years in my 30s and 40s. Mornings especially - it reached a point where I tried to only speak with people in the afternoon and evening. Now in my 50s, I'm not sure if I have completely 'outgrown' the problem, only there seemed to be a correlation between my caffeine intake and my likelihood of blushing. For years I was drinking a large mug of black coffee in the morning. Eventually I switched to green tea and the blushing seemed to mostly disappear."
2222,"I was terribly anxious about speaking in public, all through my high school and college years. My blushing would quickly turn into red blotches across my neck and upper chest. So many embarrassing moments in classrooms and on dates when I just wanted to run away and cry. Finally, while in grad school studying Architecture, I was required to give frequent presentations and teach as a TA, which was terrifying yet exactly where I wanted to be. I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed beta blockers. They were such a life saver as they allowed me to get through some crucial times. In turn, my confidence was boosted that I could actually survive and thrive in an intense academic setting, and actually not break out in giant red blotches. I began using a self taught technique of visualizing myself doing a successful presentation and doing deep calming breaths. I was able to visualize it because the beta blockers had allowed me to experience what it felt like to be calm and and confident while standing in front of a room full of professors who were critiquing my design work. It took some time, but eventually I was able to confront meetings and presentations with no pills. I still occasionally have blushing spells, but I still use the calm deep breathing and visualization, plus cold water and fans, as mentioned in this spot-on article."
2223,"Years ago, I participated in several interviews for a job with a Federal government agency.  As part of this process, I was interviewed by an FBI agent and was hooked up to a lie-detector machine.  The questions were pretty standard until the agent asked a seemingly inappropriate question.  I felt a strong blush come on.  I'm sure this reaction resulted in a big change in the lie-detector machine.  I was also angry because the agent had asked such an off-the-wall question, probably to generate the reaction I had."
2224,Propranolol was my lifesaver.  I think the author downplays it more than necessary.  It lowers blood pressure.  It’s quick and temporary (kicks in at 30 mins lasts for 2 hours).  Enough to get you through the initial bits of whatever you’re up against.
2225,This is a long time coming. China wants its tech companies to freely operate in the US yet doesn't allow US tech companies to operate in China? Make it fair competition or ban it.
2226,"This smells incredibly bad. A US President is ordering a foreign company to sell it's operations to a particular American company or be shut down.

This is rife with corporate favoritism and the part of the move towards Putin style kleptocracy. 

As a businessperson, I stay far away from countries where paying off a leader is the price of doing business. Now, it is happening in my formerly great country."
2227,"In certain respects, this would be a good match if structured correctly.  Oracle has purchased hundreds of companies, what is it known for?  It is said that Oracle is where innovation goes to die.  Oracle is known for one thing, selling expensive database tools and space.  It is least likely to become a TikTok competitor."
2228,"Trump threatened to ban TikTok unless its American operations were sold. What's to stop other countries from doing the same thing to American tech/social media companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc?"
2229,"I think you are burying the lead. first, the administration wanted the code reviewable by the NSA? i think many Americans are as wary of the NSA are they are of china.

next, what is the administration really going to do if there is no deal? trump write an executive order to prohibit anyone using the app? how would that work? if there was no app available,  why wouldn't they just make it a pure website? then trump could block the website, which is what the Chinese gov does to sites it doesn't like."
2230,"this is bunk if they are not selling

so is tiktok not selling?

is ORACLE buying Tiktok or is this a joke?

i thought Trump said SELL

what is this technology partner nonsense?

is Tiktok using Oracle to avoid the U.S. ban?

meanwhile China banned all our apps"
2231,"Nixon and Regan sold America buisness to the Chinese long ago.  America is behind the curve now and this App is a prime example of what is coming.  Remember that India and Chinese have populations over 1 billion and that means at least twice the consumers that America has with its population of 350 million.  China is engineering technology at the rate that Americans binge watch the Kardashians.  We grow fat,  lazy and more ignorant while they steal what works manufacturer it cheaper and sell it back to us for a lowest price.  Companies  care about money and patriotism gets a budget line item but only that."
2232,Why is TikTok valuable?  How does it make money?
2233,"This creates a problem- how does a lowly consumer like me boycott Oracle, now an open acolyte of the murderous Chinese Communist Party?"
2234,"Gee, Oracle's CEO is a big Trump supporter. Microsoft's CEO is not a big Trump supporter. Think TikTok is a big security threat, or just another opportunity for Larry and Donald to scam some more loot?"
2235,"This whole situation is a ludicrous. TikTok did not want to be sold. Microsoft initially was only in talks to host the data in its cloud. Then in steps the agent of chaos known as our fearless leader, followed closely by the Chinese government moving to protect one of its companies.
Microsoft dodged a bullet with this, and as for ORACLE, well it couldn't happen to a nicer company. If they manage this as well as they have managed Java, well then TikTok is hosed.
Then again, it does not really meet Trump's original criteria, since it seems that ORACLE will only be hosting the data; but it did go to a supporter, and well...you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Just another episode in the soap opera that is this administration."
2236,"Never let it be said that the Trump Administration ever put National Security interests ahead of the interests of his loyal Trumpian supporters..Obviously, Trump pushed Murdock and Oracle to the head of the line in order to pay back what Murdock has done for him (in spades) for his help with Fox News. 

 Wherever Old Chairman Mao is, he and Karl Marx must be having a roaring good laugh. Since it was Marx, I think, who observed: (Sic) ""When we come to hang the Capitalists, it will be with rope that a Capitalist company sold us.""?"
2237,Here’s betting that Oracle will do a deJoy on Tik Tok; namely deep-six it
2238,"I work for Oracle in adtech. Based on what I know about how they are with privacy and their laywers..I can't imagine that owning this app will be all that useful, especially w/o the source code."
2239,"I'm going to posit a guess that one of the reasons that ByteDance does not want it's code being transferred is that knowledge of its personalization model wouldn't sit will with the average users.

Rumors are that one of the features it uses to personalize is the algorithmic ""beauty"" of the subject. Things like this wouldn't fly in a large American company today, and it's very likely that a US company taking this over would change these, reducing the virality of the app."
2240,"This doesn't sound right.  I cant think of any software company that sells itself but keeps the code and the algorhythms of its product.  Anybody have any examples?

If Microsoft walked away from this, then Bravo Microsoft.  The sale does not seem to meet Trumps original criteria.  Strange."
2241,"Would this be, finally ,Trump’s leap from real estate and casino to the tech world that he and his were excluded from? Like, from 20th to the 21st. Century at last?  But alas, this might turn out to be Rupert Murdoch’s My Space!  Can’t wait!"
2242,Why an I not filled with confidence when I hear that the all powerful and insightful TRUMP has carefully vetted his fund raiser to over see the security of software company?
2243,"Looks like a half-hearted attempt to prevent the American governments over-sight, I wonder how this is going to fly because it doesn’t really address all of the concerns about Chinese spying and data especially if Byte Dance is still protecting the source code.

The recent changes to laws in China, and the fact Microsoft wanted to fully audit the software probably all played into this decision. At the moment I’m struggling to see how this is is a good idea, especially with Oracle’s track record."
2244,"According to NPR this morning, all TickTock deals with the US are dead. The president of China said that new export rules mean that any deal is off.  Is this true?"
2245,"Trump has shown himself to be someone who will basically, but literally, sell out the United States if it profits him. Oracle has positioned itself to suit Trump and his attempt to become an autocrat. To get it into Oracle’s hands Trump will sell out US cyber security. Tic Toc is a potential avenue for China to practice manipulation of people in the US if the security arrangements for use in the US are not established. The security arrangements, moreover, are a supposed ‘line in the sand’ for the Pompeo State Department. There couldn’t be a more clear statement that Trump is president of and for himself and himself only. Where are the corporate powers to balance the Koch juggernaut. Maybe now Microsoft. Maybe now!"
2246,What's Trump's cut on this deal?
2247,"A friend of mine is a cyber security expert, and he said you should NEVER install TikTok on any of your devices. 

Trump has other motivations, of course, but still: don’t use TikTok."
2248,"Trump has repeatedly and publicly stated that, as a precondition for allowing a US company to acquire TikTok, the US Treasury should receive “a very big proportion” of the acquisition price. This is an obvious solicitation for bribery, and if followed through, would be a clear violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Trump has compared this solicitation for bribery with a realtor demanding a “key fee” before allowing a tenant to move into a property. To be clear, “key fees” are bribes, and Trump’s comfort with such bribes as a “normal” part of doing business should raise numerous legal red flags. 

Neither Trump nor Oracle Corporation are exemplars of honesty and probity. If the Oracle acquisition of TikTok goes through, federal regulators and investigative reporters must keep a close eye on where the money goes in the deal."
2249,"This deal is like a 60 year old cruising Tinder for a date with an 18 year old - creepy and weird. 

If they haven't left yet, I'm sure the exodus will come with the 125 page licensing agreement and payment requirement Oracle is sure to impose."
